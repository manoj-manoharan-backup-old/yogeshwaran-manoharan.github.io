Operators interact with a single logical control plane that they can use to define how they want CockroachDB to store their row-level data. Meanwhile, developers continue to interact with our PostgreSQL-compatible API that transparently handles distributing queries across a global cluster. With our 2.0 release, we introduced a new cluster visualization in our web UI to help operators monitor a global cluster.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cluster-visualization/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"Scraping Paginated Lists With Node.js, Cheerio, Async / Await, And Recursion","description":"\n                    <p>In this tutorial we are going to develop a small Node.js application which will be used to scrape paginated content and export the data to a JSON file.
