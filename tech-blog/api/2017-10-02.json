[{"title":"\nStreams: a new general purpose data structure in Redis.\n","description":"Until a few months ago, for me streams were no more than an interesting and relatively straightforward concept in the context of messaging. After Kafka popularized the concept, I mostly investigated their usefulness in the case of Disque, a message queue that is now headed to be translated into a Redis 4.2 module. Later I decided that Disque was all about AP messaging, which is, fault tolerance and guarantees of delivery without much efforts from the client, so I decided that the concept of streams was not a good match in that case.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/114\n","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"NativeScript Sidekick For Assisted Project Creation And Cloud Building","description":"\n                    <p>I was recently at <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/09/native-hybrid-back-again/\">NativeScript Developer Days 2017</a> and I was anxious to learn more about Telerik&rsquo;s new developer tool called <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick\">NativeScript Sidekick</a>.
