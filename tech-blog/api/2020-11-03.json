[{"title":"BPF binaries: BTF, CO-RE, and the future of BPF perf tools","description":"Two new technologies, BTF and CO-RE, are paving the way for BPF to become a billion-dollar industry. Right now there are many BPF (eBPF) startups building networking, security, and performance products (and more in stealth), yet requiring customers to install the LLVM, Clang, and kernel header dependencies &ndash; which can consume over 100 Mbytes of storage &ndash; is an adoption drag. BTF and CO-RE eliminate these dependencies at runtime, not only making BPF more practical for embedded Linux environments, but for adoption everywhere.\n","link":"http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2020-11-04/bpf-co-re-btf-libbpf.html","owner":"Brendan Eich"},{"title":"Everyday Systems That Help Me","description":"At some point in my life, I read A Case Against Optimizing Your Life , and I took it to heart, and I lived by it.
