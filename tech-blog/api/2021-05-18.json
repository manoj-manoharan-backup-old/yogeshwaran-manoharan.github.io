For this release, we took a step back and asked how we can make even more development teams successful with multi-region clusters. Thousands of engineering hours and Github tickets later, the result of our efforts is a dramatically simpler and more accessible developer experience for managing the location of data.\nCockroachDB’s multi-region capabilities are a core set of features that let you manage data across multiple cloud availability zones and regions, to optimize latency and availability.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-21-1-release/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"CodeSOD: Mastery Through Repetition","description":"<p>When I was a baby programmer, I subscribed to a computer magazine. In those olden times, these magazines would come with pages of program code, usually BASIC, so that you could type this program into your computer and run it. If you were careful about typos, you could accomplish quite a bit of &#34;programming&#34; without actually programming. What you were doing, in practice, was just <em>typing</em>.</p>\r\n<p>One of <strong>Anthony</strong>&#39;s predecessors was quite the accomplished typist.</p>\r\n<p>They needed to take the built-in .NET <code>XmlDocument</code> class and add a one method to it. Now, C# offers a few techniques for doing this. The &#34;traditional&#34; object-oriented approach is to use inheritance. Now, that&#39;s not without its downsides, so C# also has the concept of &#34;extension methods&#34;. This is a little bit of syntactic sugar, which allows you to declare static method that takes a parameter of <code>XmlDocument</code>, but invoke it as <em>if</em> it ","link":"https://thedailywtf.com/articles/mastery-through-repetition","owner":"The Coded Self"},{"title":"Comparing the efficiency of the Harrell-Davis, Sfakianakis-Verginis, and Navruz-Özdemir quantile estimators","description":"<p>In the previous posts, I discussed the statistical efficiency of different quantile estimators\n(<a href=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/hdqe-efficiency/\">Efficiency of the Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</a> and\n<a href=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/wthdqe-efficiency/\">Efficiency of the winsorized and trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimators</a>).</p>\n<p>In this post, I continue this research and compare the efficiency of\nthe Harrell-Davis quantile estimator,\nthe <a href=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/sfakianakis-verginis-quantile-estimator/\">Sfakianakis-Verginis quantile estimators</a>, and\nthe <a href=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/navruz-ozdemir-quantile-estimator/\">Navruz-Özdemir quantile estimator</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"mx-auto\">\n<a href=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/hd-sv-no-efficiency/img/LightAndHeavy_N10_Efficiency-light.png\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"imgldlink\" alt=\"LightAndHeavy_N10_Efficiency\">\n<picture>\n<source\ntheme='dark'\nsrcset=\"https://aakinshin.net/posts/hd-s","link":"https://aakinshin.net/posts/hd-sv-no-efficiency/","owner":"Andrew Ray"},{"title":"Composer Path Repositories","description":"This entry is part 1 of 5 in the series Shopware's Development Environment.

Your developers get feedback on their changes immediately instead of weeks after making them to a private branch and then finally integrating it. Without feature flags, you have three choices when it’s time to fix them: - Roll back to the previous build - Code and integrate an emergency fix - Leave the broken feature in the wild until it’s fixed in a regular release LONG-LIVED FEATURE BRANCHES How do you avoid the problems outlined above when you don’t have feature flags?","link":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/feature-flags-in-ci","owner":"CleverTap"},{"title":"JavaScript Strings: 10 Fundamentals You Should Know","description":null,"link":"https://medium.com/dailyjs/javascript-strings-10-fundamentals-you-should-know-d29e6e5f3a1a?source=rss----f5105b08f43a---4","owner":"Codrops"},{"title":"JPA Entity Graph","description":null,"link":"https://vladmihalcea.com/jpa-entity-graph/","owner":"Vanilla Java"},{"title":"Julien Delange’s Plan to Slash Your Technical Debt","description":"Julien began his journey to CEO of Code Inspector in his native France, where he earned a PhD. in computer science and started his career at the European Space Agency writing software for rockets and satellites.
