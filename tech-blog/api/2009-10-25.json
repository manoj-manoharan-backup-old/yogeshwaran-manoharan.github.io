[{"title":"They are just tools, people!","description":"<p>Codaset is openly asking its users to comment on what pricing strategy they would like most. I&rsquo;ve spotted this before, but again, there are two types of users. Those who see a great service and know that it will make their job easier, so they are willing to pay for it. There are also those who want a trillion repositories, unlimited disk space and what not for $1 a month (or less). This post is for the latter group of people.</p>\n<p>Some developers claim they <em>need</em> to use all of 37Signals' apps, have the biggest Github plan available and buy that new shiny 17&quot; MacBook Pro (or that 27&quot; iMac, I know). With all those tools and hardware available, how can your brilliant plan not succeed? All the successful people you&rsquo;ve heard of use them. So, with all that setup, you&rsquo;re golden! Right? Then they check the price tag. It&rsquo;s huge!</p>","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/10/25/they-are-just-tools-people/","owner":"Antirez"}]
