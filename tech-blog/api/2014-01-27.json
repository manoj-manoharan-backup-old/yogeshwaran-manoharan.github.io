[{"title":"Post-mortem: The big outage on January 25, 2014","description":"\n<p>25th January was a rather unfortunate day for us. The monthly challenge -\n<a href=\"http://www.hackerearth.com/january-jackpot2014/\">January Jackpot 2014</a> which\nwas scheduled at 9:30 PM that day was cancelled due to turn of events going\nwrong at the worst possible time. We regret once again for the incovenience\ncaused to you, and this is a postemortem of what really happened behind\nthe scenes.</p>\n\n<p>It was Saturday, and the day was sunny here. Everything was running smoothly as\nusual. The whole HackerEarth team was out roaming in Bangalore, went to a lake, did\nboat ride, went for a lunch then and came back to office in evening. We all\nsang with the guitar and played counter strike. At the same time, there was\na college contest -\n<a href=\"http://www.hackerearth.com/epiphanyjanuary/\">Epiphany January Challenge</a> going\non. Everything was smooth, the servers were sending replies happily and we\ndidnâ€™t have to worry about anything.</p>\n\n<p>This is the email I received in the evenin","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2014/01/27/big-outage-25-january/","owner":"Gusto"}]
