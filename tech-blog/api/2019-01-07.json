[{"title":"Implementing U2F Authentication With Hardware Keys Using Node.js and Vue.js","description":"\n                    <p>Not too long ago I had written a tutorial titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/u2f-authentication-yubikey-nodejs-jquery/\">U2F Authentication with a YubiKey Using Node.js and jQuery</a>, which demonstrated how to use hardware keys as a means of universal two-factor (U2F) authentication. However, I had left some things to be desired in that previous post. For example, the previous tutorial did not use proper session management with Express.js and it used jQuery, which is neat, but by no means is as popular as some of the other web frameworks that currently exist.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&rsquo;re going to expand upon what we had done previously, but implement proper session management with <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a> and use <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a>, which is a modern web framework.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/01/implementing-u2f-authentication-hardware-keys-nodejs-vuejs/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"mkcert: valid HTTPS certificates for localhost","description":"kg-card-begin: markdown","link":"https://blog.filippo.io/mkcert-valid-https-certificates-for-localhost/","owner":"Federico Tomassetti"}]
