[{"title":"The migration that cannot be undone: Irreversible Migration","description":"Migrations have up and down methods, as we all know. But in some cases, your up method does things you can&rsquo;t undo in your down method.\nFor example:\ndef self.up # Change the zipcode from the current :integer to a :string type. change_column :address, :zipcode, :string end Now, converting integers to strings will always work. But, you feel it coming, converting a string into an integer will not always be possible.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/05/06/the-migration-that-cannot-be-undone-irreversible-migration/","owner":"Antirez"}]
