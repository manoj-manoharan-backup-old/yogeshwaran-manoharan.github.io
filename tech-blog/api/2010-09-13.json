[{"title":"Dear Twitter: Stop screwing over your developers. ","description":"I really like Twitter. I think it&rsquo;s a great, fun, service, that helps enable interesting online communities, and is a surprisingly effective way to spread news and information to lots of people online. One of the things that I&rsquo;ve loved about Twitter is their API, and how open and welcoming they&rsquo;ve been to developers. I even use Twitter from an IM client that I develop, using protocol support that I wrote myself.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/09/dear-twitter/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
