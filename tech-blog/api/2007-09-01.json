[{"title":"Content_for, yield and making sure something gets displayed","description":"You may have heard of a very nice Rails technique that used content_for and yield to stuff custom blocks of content into a layout. For example, in a view you could add a block like this:\nThis goes into the sidebar when viewing this action!  It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you put it in the view, because, as you may notice, the content within the content_for block is not shown in the view.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/09/01/content_for-yield-and-making-sure-something-gets-displayed/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
