[{"title":"\nEnglish has been my pain for 15 years\n","description":"Paul Graham managed to put a very important question, the one of the English language as a requirement for IT workers, in the attention zone of news sites and software developers [1]. It was a controversial matter as he referred to \"foreign accents\" and the internet is full of people that are just waiting to overreact, but this is the least interesting part of the question, so I'll skip that part. The important part is, no one talks about the \"English problem\" usually, and I always felt a bit alone in that side, like if it was a problem only affecting me, so in this blog post I want to share my experience about English.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/61\n","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"}]
