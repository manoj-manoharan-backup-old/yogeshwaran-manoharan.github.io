[{"title":"Synchronize goroutines in your tests","description":"I have been working on an emulator for the MOS 6502 Microprocessor, written in Go. As part of this package I have also implemented a minimal 6551 Asynchronous Communication Interface Adapter. The 6551 provides serial IO and is easy to use in combination with the 6502.\nWhen the microprocessor writes a byte to the 6551 it is stored in the tx (transmit) register where it&rsquo;s available for other hardware components to read.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2014/08/29/synchronize-goroutines-in-your-tests/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
