I&rsquo;m still surprised the engineering team let me anywhere near the stuff they did.\nWhen I first interned four years ago, we had declared a just code yellow to focus our energy towards stabilizing CRDB. Having joined the newly-formed distributed query execution1 team, but now with its focus directed elsewhere, what this meant for me was free rein to flesh out distributed hash and merge joins2, few aggregation primitives (think SUM, COUNT, DISTINCT, etc.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/from-interns-with-love-cockroachdb-internship-projects/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"How to configure clients to connect to Apache Kafka Clusters securely â€“ Part 3: PAM authentication","description":null,"link":"https://blog.cloudera.com/how-to-configure-clients-to-connect-to-apache-kafka-clusters-securely-part-3-pam-authentication/","owner":"CloudBees"},{"title":"Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm (part II): DFA version","description":"Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm (part II): DFA version","link":"https://yurichev.com/news/20210121_Knuth_Morris_Pratt_2/","owner":"Dennis Felsing"},{"title":"Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm (part III): DFA-less version","description":"Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm (part III): DFA-less version","link":"https://yurichev.com/news/20210121_Knuth_Morris_Pratt_3/","owner":"Dennis Felsing"},{"title":"Machine Learning Number Recognition - From Zero to Application","description":"Harnessing the potential of machine learning for computer vision is not a new concept but recent advances and the availability of new tools and datasets have made it more accessible to developers.\r\n\r\nIn this article, Toptal Software Developer Teimur Gasanov demonstrates how you can create an app capable of identifying handwritten digits in under 30 minutes, including the API and UI.","link":"https://www.toptal.com/data-science/machine-learning-number-recognition","owner":"Tinder"},{"title":"ReactJS Girls Goes Virtual","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/yld-blog/reactjs-girls-goes-virtual-7b59db64b48?source=rss----39c536548b9a---4","owner":"Yelp"},{"title":"Yet another use of regex backreferences","description":"Yet another use of regex backreferences","link":"https://yurichev.com/news/20210121_regex_backref/","owner":"Dennis Felsing"}]
