[{"title":"Changing A NativeScript CSS Skin At Runtime","description":"\n                    <p>CSS is usually a subject I avoid due to me being artistically illiterate, but recently a student of mine asked me an interesting question regarding theming an Angular <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> application with dynamic CSS files loaded at runtime. Given the nature of Angular, it becomes difficult to load files at runtime because of how Angular compiles and builds projects. NativeScript Angular projects are no exception when it comes to switching a CSS skin.</p>\n<p>So what if we want to apply a set of CSS styles on demand, but keep them separated in their own files?</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re going to see how to switch between files to apply a CSS skin to a NativeScript Angular application on demand at runtime.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/11/changing-a-nativescript-css-skin-at-runtime/'>Changing A NativeScript CSS Skin At Runtime</a> appeared first o","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/11/changing-a-nativescript-css-skin-at-runtime/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
