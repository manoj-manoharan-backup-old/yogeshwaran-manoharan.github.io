[{"title":"Using C Dynamic Libraries In Go Programs","description":"My son and I were having fun last weekend building a console based game in Go. I was recreating a game from my youth, back when I was programming on a Kaypro II.\nI loved this computer. I would write games in BASIC on it all day and night. Did I mention it was portable. The keyboard would strap in and you could carry it around. LOL.\nBut I digress, back to my Go program.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/08/using-c-dynamic-libraries-in-go-programs.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
