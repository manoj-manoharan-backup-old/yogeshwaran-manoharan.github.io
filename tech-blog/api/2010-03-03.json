[{"title":"Followup to \"A Very Subtle Bug\"","description":"After my previous post got posted to reddit, there was a bunch of interesting discussion there about some details I&rsquo;d handwaved over. This is a quick followup on some the investigation that various people carried out, and the conclusions they reached.\nIn the reddit thread, lacos/lbzip2 objected that in his experiments, he didn&rsquo;t see tar closing the input pipe before it was done reading the file, and so questioned where the SIGPIPE/EPIPE was coming from in the first place.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/03/followup-to-a-very-subtle-bug/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
