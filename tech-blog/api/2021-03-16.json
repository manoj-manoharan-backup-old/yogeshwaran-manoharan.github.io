We know because we’ve dealt with these problems ourselves. Any business needs to track metrics, from customer activity to the internal workings of the company. But how can we keep those metrics up to date to extract maximum business value? Here at Cockroach Labs we build CockroachDB, a distributed database meant to survive everything and thrive everywhere. CockroachDB is primarily optimized for transactional- “OLTP”- data, and sometimes it is advantageous to stream that data to an analytical warehouse to run frequent, large queries.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/from-batch-to-streaming-data-real-time-monitoring-with-snowflake-looker-and-cockroachdb/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"How to Improve App Settings UX","description":"Well-designed settings panels allow users to tailor apps to their needs and help companies lower customer-support costs.

The methods deployed to achieve the desired result usually differ in sophistication and implementation, however, effectiveness is usually the end goal (of course, with thoughtful consideration of potential tradeoffs). Defenders can […]","link":"https://bohops.com/2021/03/16/investigating-net-clr-usage-log-tampering-techniques-for-edr-evasion/","owner":"Blundell's Android Tutorials"},{"title":"Java Reactive Programming - Effective Usage in a Real World Application","description":"This article presents how trivago&rsquo;s search backend team used reactive programming in Java effectively when designing and implementing one of our many Java backend services. Compared to traditional imperative and functional programming, reactive programming requires a mindset-shift in order to apply the concepts and techniques effectively. The benefits we gain support us in some key challenges that every engineer is facing with essentially every (micro-) service in today’s backend architectures: handling of blocking IO, backpressure, managing highly varying loads as well as message and error propagation.","link":"https://tech.trivago.com/2021/03/16/java-reactive-programming-effective-usage-in-a-real-world-application/","owner":"TripAdvisor"},{"title":"Managing Kubernetes using Terraform","description":null,"link":"https://soshace.com/managing-kubernetes-using-terraform/","owner":"Songkick"},{"title":"ML Feature Serving Infrastructure at Lyft","description":"","link":"https://eng.lyft.com/ml-feature-serving-infrastructure-at-lyft-d30bf2d3c32a?source=rss----25cd379abb8---4","owner":"Localytics"},{"title":"Navruz-Özdemir quantile estimator","description":"<p>The Navruz-Özdemir quantile estimator\nsuggests the following equation to estimate the <span class=\"math inline\">\\(p^\\textrm{th}\\)</span> quantile of sample <span class=\"math inline\">\\(X\\)</span>:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[\\begin{split}\n\\operatorname{NO}_p =\n& \\Big( (3p-1)X_{(1)} + (2-3p)X_{(2)} - (1-p)X_{(3)} \\Big) B_0 +\\\\\n& +\\sum_{i=1}^n \\Big((1-p)B_{i-1}+pB_i\\Big)X_{(i)} +\\\\\n& +\\Big( -pX_{(n-2)} + (3p-1)X_{(n-1)} + (2-3p)X_{(n)} \\Big) B_n\n\\end{split}\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math inline\">\\(B_i = B(i; n, p)\\)</span> is probability mass function of the binomial distribution <span class=\"math inline\">\\(B(n, p)\\)</span>,\n<span class=\"math inline\">\\(X_{(i)}\\)</span> are order statistics of sample <span class=\"math inline\">\\(X\\)</span>.</p>\n<p>In this post, I derive these equations following the paper\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12198\">&ldquo;A new quantile estimator with weights based on a subsampling approach&rdquo;</a> (2020)\nby Gözde Navruz and A.
