[{"title":"5 Beginner-Friendly Coding Livestreams to Learn Programming","description":"The past year has been a great year for code livestreams. Stuck at home, developers took to their OBS setups to share their coding projects with their peers. And viewers tuned in to watch a fellow developer struggle through a programming issue, get stuck, google things, and eventually figure things out, and found their coding communities in the process.\nBut if you are a code newbie, you might find it daunting to follow along with the experienced developers' livestreams.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/5-coding-streams-for-beginners/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"Building secure applications: Top 10 application security best practices","description":null,"link":"https://blog.sqreen.com/best-practices-build-secure-applications/","owner":"Spotify"},{"title":"Hybrid Cloud and Strategic Data Use Accelerate State, Army Missions","description":null,"link":"https://blog.cloudera.com/hybrid-cloud-and-strategic-data-use-accelerate-state-army-missions/","owner":"CloudBees"},{"title":"I Earn $100 per Hour Writing On Medium — You Can Too.","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/dailyjs/i-earn-100-per-hour-writing-on-medium-you-can-too-69bbccec9540?source=rss----f5105b08f43a---4","owner":"Codrops"},{"title":"Improving Android's Auth Flow with PKCE","description":"<p><img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dhttas9u5/image/upload/c_fill,fl_progressive,h_800,q_auto,w_1600/dan-nelson-ah-HeguOe9k-unsplash_rsfi6j.jpg' /></p>\n<p>Android clients need to be able to connect with servers in a safe, secure manner. In recent years, the <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749'>OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow</a> has become the standard mechanism of doing this. While this practice safeguards clients from a myriad of security attacks, it’s still not completely impenetrable.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dhttas9u5/image/upload/default-auth-flow_yyame5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>When making an authorization request, the server returns an authorization code. It’s possible for an attacker to intercept this code and then use it to request an access token. To prevent this sort of attack, servers can employ an extension to the authorization code flow called <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636'>Proof Key for Code Exchange</a>, or PKCE.</p>\n\n<h2 i","link":"https://technology.doximity.com/articles/improving-android-s-auth-flow-with-pkce","owner":"DoorDash"},{"title":"Our Journey to a Generic Linking Platform","description":null,"link":"https://eng.wealthfront.com/2021/04/01/our-journey-to-a-generic-linking-platform/","owner":"Wayfair"},{"title":"Snyk chats with Shutterstock about building a DevSecOps culture","description":"Buying security tooling is easy, but changing company culture is hard.
