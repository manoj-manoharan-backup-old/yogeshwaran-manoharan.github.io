[{"title":"DEF CON","description":"I&rsquo;m sitting in the airport in Las Vegas on the way back from [DEF CON][http://defcon.org] 15. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been at the con, and it wasn&rsquo;t really what I expected. Frankly, I walked away feeling kinda underwhelmed.\nVery few of the talks were as technical as I was hoping &ndash; they were almost universally broad overviews of an area, with lots of introduction, and relatively little, to my eye, technical meat.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2007/08/def-con/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
