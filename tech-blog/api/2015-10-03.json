[{"title":"A makefile for Golang CLI tools","description":"Note: I&rsquo;ve received feedback on this post and written an update, which you can read here\nIt&rsquo;s no secret I love the power and simplicity of Go. To further train my skills I wrote a simple app that will roll dice from the command line, because you know, that&rsquo;s very useful.\nThere are two goals for me in this project right now: make it trivial to use compile time variables and have a Makefile for easy compilation, installation and clean up.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2015/10/03/a-makefile-for-golang-cli-tools/","owner":"Antirez"}]
