[{"title":"Documenting Go Code With Godoc","description":"As you know if you read my blog, I have been building a set of new utility packages so I can start developing an application server I need for a new project. I am brand new to Go and the Mac OS. Needless to say it has been one hell of an education over the past month. But I don&rsquo;t miss Windows or C# at all.\nI made some progress in my coding and wanted to build documentation for the code.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/06/documenting-go-code-with-godoc.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"},{"title":"Scheduling emails with celery in Django","description":"\n<p>After a long journey with Django, you come to a place where you feel the need to\nget some tasks done asynchronously without any supervision of human. Some tasks\nneed to be scheduled to run once at a particular time or after some time and\nsome tasks have to be run periodically like\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\">crontab</a>. One of the tasks is\nsending emails on specific triggers.</p>\n\n<p>Here at <a href=\"http://www.hackerearth.com/\">HackerEarth</a>\n, one of the major chunk of emails is sent to recruiters and participants after \na contest is finished or when participant triggers finish-test button. \nTill now we had done this using crontab. But things have changed now and\nscaling with such process is time and resource consuming.\nAlso, looking in to database if there is any task that has to be done with crontab process is not a\ngood method, atleast for those tasks those have to run only once in the\nlifetime.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n####Django-Celery\n<a href=\"http://docs.celeryproj","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/06/05/scheduling-emails-with-celery-in-django/","owner":"Gusto"}]
