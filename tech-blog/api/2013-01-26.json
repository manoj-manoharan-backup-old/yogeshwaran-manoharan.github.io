[{"title":"\nA few thoughts about Open Source Software\n","description":"For a decade and half I contributed to open source regularly, and still it is relatively rare that I stop to think a bit more about what this means for me. Probably it is just because I like to write code, so this is how I use my time: writing code instead of thinking about what this meansâ€¦ however lately I'm starting to have a few recurring ideas about open source, its relationship with the IT industry, and my interpretation of what OSS is, for me, as a developer.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/48\n","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Christina with my new horse, Handyman.","description":"<img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/31f4f26afd0667ab29d5cf7200bff22e/tumblr_mh8umhScGz1qgj4z8o1_500.jpg\"/><br/><br/><p>Christina with my new horse, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/handyman.b\" title=\"Handyman\" target=\"_blank\">Handyman</a>.</p>","link":"https://codebeforethehorse.tumblr.com/post/41533588484","owner":"Stefan Parker"}]
