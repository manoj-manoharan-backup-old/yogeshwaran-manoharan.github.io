I encourage you to attend or at least swing by and say hello.</p>\n<p>The title of my talk is <strong>Building Offline First Mobile Applications</strong> and the abstract is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What happens when your mobile device does not have a network connection?  That device will have no content, no experience and the amazing application that you spent so much effort to build just simply will not work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will gain knowledge in NoSQL databases technologies and walk away with insights on how to create offline type of applications that to sync to the cloud with Couchbase Mobile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a free event, so if you’re available and are interested in learning about mobile technologies, mark it on your calendar.
