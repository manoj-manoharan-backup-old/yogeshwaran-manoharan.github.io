[{"title":"ActiveScaffold, Acts_as_taggable_on_steroids","description":"Update: also read Active Scaffold + Acts_as_taggable + Auto Completion.\nThis is kind of an advanced topic, but I think it may be useful to a lot of people.\nActiveScaffold is a great plugin to start building a user interface.

When editing a model, you can easily add or select another model that you want to associate with is.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/06/11/activescaffold-acts_as_taggable_on_steroids/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
