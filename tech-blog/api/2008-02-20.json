[{"title":"todo.pl ratmenu","description":"broder has been hacking on some better quicksilver integration for Hiveminder using todo.pl.\nI don&rsquo;t use a mac, but I don&rsquo;t see why linux users shouldn&rsquo;t get fun toys to. So I hacked up the following two-liner that uses todo.pl and ratmenu to pop up a list of tasks, and mark one as completed:\n#!/bin/sh todo.pl | perl -ne 'push @a,$2,&quot;todo.pl done $1&quot; if /^#([\\w]+) (.+)$/;' \\ -e 'END{exec(&quot;ratmenu&quot;,@a)}'  I dropped it into my ~/bin and bound it to C-t x in my window manager (XMonad).","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/02/todopl-ratmenu/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
