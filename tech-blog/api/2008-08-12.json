[{"title":"Ruby on Rails: UUID as your ActiveRecord primary key","description":"Sometimes, using the good old &lsquo;auto increment&rsquo; from your database just isn&rsquo;t good enough. If you really require that all your objects have unique ID, even across systems and different databases there&rsquo;s only one way go: UUID or Universally Unique IDentifier.\nA UUID is generated in such a way that every generated UUID in the world is unique. For example: 12f186e6-687e-11ad-843e-001b632783f1. This string is randomly generated based on several factors that guarantee it&rsquo;s uniqueness.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/08/12/ruby-on-rails-uuid-as-your-activerecord-primary-key/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
