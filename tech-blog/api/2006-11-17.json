All you need is a CSE (of course) and optionally a Google Analytics account to track who&rsquo;s coming by.\nSystem requirements are pretty low. You&rsquo;ll only need PHP 4.3.x or better. Check out the SourceForge Project Page or jump directly to the downloads section.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/11/17/announcing-cse-tool-deploy-you-google-cse-with-ease/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
