[{"title":"RecyclerView basics","description":"<h2 id=\"introduction-to-recyclerview\">Introduction to RecyclerView</h2>\n\n<p><code>RecyclerView</code> has been introduced with Android 5, in the support-v7 package. It\nallows to display a collection of items in an arbitrary disposition (think of a\n<code>ListView</code>, but much more flexible). As the name of the support package\nindicates, it&rsquo;s available from the API level 7 (Android 2.1).</p>\n\n<p>Its name comes from the way it works: when an item is hidden, instead of being\ndestroyed and a new one being created for each newly displayed item, hidden ones\nare <em>recycled</em>: they are reused, with new data bound on them.</p>","link":"https://enoent.fr/posts/recyclerview-basics/","owner":"Manu Sporny"}]
