[{"title":"Now powered by Heroku","description":"This is just a quick note to let everyone know Ariejan.net is now proudly hosted by Heroku. Since this site is powered by a toto (a rack-based blog engine) and no database, Heroku is the perfect hosting solution.\n~\nAll articles are simple text files (with some YAML front-matter to specify title, tags, etc.) and are kept under Git version control. Deploying Ariejan.net is a simple git push to Heroku.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/12/31/now-powered-by-heroku/","owner":"Antirez"}]
