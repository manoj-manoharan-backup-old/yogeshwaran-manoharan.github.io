[{"title":"Mass convert WMA to MP3 using ffmpeg and ruby","description":"Today I found myself in a situation where I have a few (200+) WMA audio files. Due to personal preference I want MP3, not WMA. So, let&rsquo;s convert that lot.\nWhat I want to do is convert all those WMA files to constant bitrate 192kbps, stereo mp3 files. (In my case, the WMA files have the required quality to use this settings). ~ The first tool you need is ffmpeg. If you&rsquo;re on Mac, simple run brew install ffmpeg.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/09/11/mass-convert-wma-to-mp3-using-ffmpeg-and-ruby/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
