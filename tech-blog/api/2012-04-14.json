[{"title":"Decorating Devise's current_user with Draper","description":"I&rsquo;ve become a big fan of decorators, especially Draper.\nDecorators allow you to move view related functionality for your models in to separate decorator classes. This keeps both your models and views clean and readable.\nAnyway, if you use Devise you&rsquo;re provided with a current_user helper. However, this helper returns an instance of User - without your decorators. To enable decorators for your current_user by default, simple add this to app/controllers/application_controller.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/04/14/decorating-devise-s-current_user-with-draper/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
