[{"title":"Build a Python App with SQLAlchemy + CockroachDB","description":"One of the great things about CockroachDB&#x2019;s support for SQL is the ecosystem of frameworks, ORMs, and other tools for working with SQL data. SQLAlchemy is just one of the ORMs in that ecosystem, and one we use quite a bit for Python projects. You&#x2019;ll find it referenced in some of our sample applicationdocs, and our upcoming &#x201C;CockroachDB for Python Developers&#x201D; course has students use SQLAlchemy and Flask in projects.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/sqlalchemy-support/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"Hacking From Home","description":"","link":"https://tech.buzzfeed.com/hacking-from-home-c6bae35b124b?source=rss----140b2c7c3466---4","owner":"Brandwatch"},{"title":"Standing for Safety: Meet the Uber Sao Paulo Tech Team","description":null,"link":"https://eng.uber.com/meet-sao-paulo-tech/","owner":"Twitch"}]
