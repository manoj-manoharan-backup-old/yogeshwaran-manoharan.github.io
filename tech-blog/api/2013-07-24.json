[{"title":"Analyze Data With MongoDB and Go","description":"This article was written for and published by Safari Books Online\nMy company is building a mobile application called Outcast. The idea behind Outcast is to give people who love the outdoors the ability to get ahead of the weather. By analyzing real time buoy, tide, lunar and solar data with user preferences and experiences, the application can deliver relevant information and forecasts. The user helps with the forecasting by providing an experience review after their outdoor activities have ended.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/07/analyze-data-with-mongodb-and-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"},{"title":"IR is better than assembly","description":"","link":"https://idea.popcount.org/2013-07-24-ir-is-better-than-assembly","owner":"Marco Pivetta"}]
