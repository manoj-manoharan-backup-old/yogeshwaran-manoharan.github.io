[{"title":"wpa_supplicant: GUI and wpa_action","description":"I&rsquo;ve made two new interesting discoveries about wpa_supplicant since writing my last blog post on the subject. (Actually, I pretty much made both of them while reading documentation in order to write it, and have been lame about writing them up).\nUsing wpa_gui It turns out that wpa_gui not only allows you to select existing networks, but also to scan for and add new networks to your configuration file. In addition, you can run it as yourself, without needing to sudo it.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/09/wpa_supplicant-gui-and-wpa_action/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
