[{"title":"Fixing a slow starting Terminal or iTerm2 on Mac OS X","description":"For some time I have been annoyed with how slow my Terminal (in my case iTerm2) starts up. It would take 5-10 seconds before I was presented a prompt. Being in the console for the better part of the day, this was unacceptable.\nThe first thing I did was upgrade Bash to Zsh. I&rsquo;d heard great things about Zsh, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. Zsh is really awesome, but it did not fix the start-up delay I was experiencing previously with Bash.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/11/08/fixing-a-slow-starting-terminal-or-iterm2-on-mac-os-x/","owner":"Antirez"}]
