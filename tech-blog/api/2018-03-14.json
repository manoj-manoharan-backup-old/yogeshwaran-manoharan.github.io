It was a great example of accomplishing something with Go and very little code.</p>\n<p>Scanning for BLE devices is a great use case for Internet of Things (IoT) devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero W, and Golang isn&rsquo;t the only great language around. I, like many others, do a lot of Node.js development as well.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to see how to scan for BLE iBeacon devices using Node.js and the popular Node.js BLE (Noble) library.</p>\n                    \n                        ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/03/use-nodejs-raspberry-pi-zero-w-scan-ble-ibeacon-devices/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
