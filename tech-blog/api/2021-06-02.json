Why did they see such a stark difference between the two cloud providers? They set out to test the performance of GCP and AWS in more detail, ultimately comparing the two platforms across a host of benchmarks including CPU, network, storage I/O, and TPC-C performance (e.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cpu-performance-benchmarks/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"Agile Transformation in Banking from Strategy to Execution","description":"<div class=\"hs-featured-image-wrapper\"> \r\n <a href=\"https://blog.avenuecode.com/agile-transformation-in-banking-from-strategy-to-execution\" title=\"\" class=\"hs-featured-image-link\"> <img src=\"https://blog.avenuecode.com/hubfs/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-3.jpg\" alt=\"Agile Transformation in Banking from Strategy to Execution\" class=\"hs-featured-image\" style=\"width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\"> </a> \r\n</div>    \r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Digital transformation has not chosen specific verticals to show its importance.
