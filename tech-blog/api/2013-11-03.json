[{"title":"Jon Skeet's Quiz","description":"<p>Jon Skeet was once asked to give three questions to check how well you know C#. He asked the <a href=\"http://www.dotnetcurry.com/magazine/jon-skeet-quiz.aspx\">following questions</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q1.</strong> <em>What constructor call can you write such that this prints True (at least on the Microsoft .NET implementation)?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-cs\" data-lang=\"cs\"><span class=\"kt\">object</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"cm\">/* fill in code here */</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">object</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"cm\">/* fill in code here */</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">WriteLine</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">);","link":"https://aakinshin.net/posts/jon-skeet-quiz/","owner":"Andrew Ray"},{"title":"Rendering images for Retina or any high DPI screens.","description":"Authoring HTML and CSS has come a long way. As opposed to the regime built in past, today we focus on lots of thing while authoring a page. We follow the standards and best practices and create semantic HTML with visual properties separated out in CSS. Here I&rsquo;ll not talk about writing semantic HTML and CSS but will focus on rendering images for latest devices having device pixel ratio of 2(Retina Display), 3(Galaxy S4) and even more in near future.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-11-03-image-rendering-on-hd-screens/","owner":"Codelitt"},{"title":"Using XSLT With Go","description":"I am working on a project that requires pulling and processing different XML feeds from the web and storing the data into MongoDB as JSON. Since new feeds come up everyday, changing the Go program to process and publish new feeds is out of the question. A second constraint is that processing has to work in Iron.io or any other linux cloud based environment.\nWhat I needed was a Go program that could take an XML document and XSLT stylesheet at runtime, transform the XML into JSON and then store the JSON to MongoDB.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/11/using-xslt-with-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
