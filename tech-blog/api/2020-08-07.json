After a successful kick-off earlier this year, we now support the swisstopo cartography team in building the next generation of swisstopo maps, powered by the technology of vector tiles. Their first goal is to provide a new light base map, a backdrop map optimized to overlay thematic layers of the Federal Spatial Data Infrastructure FSDI and many other data.</p>\n\n<p>Swisstopo maps are both beautiful and accurate while being renowned for their unique visual style. Our challenge is to introduce as much “Swissness” as possible in the new vector styles while making the maps fast and keeping the datasets aligned with the high standards set by swisstopo cartographers.</p>\n\n<p>It has long been a personal dream of mine, to be able to contribute to the field o","link":"https://www.maptiler.com/news/2020/08/swisstopo-vector-tiles-development/","owner":"MapTiler"}]
