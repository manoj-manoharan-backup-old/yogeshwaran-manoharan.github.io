[{"title":"Consume RESTful API Endpoints Within A Golang Application","description":"\n                    <p>I am a huge fan of the Go programming language and have written a decent amount of material on the subject. For example, a popular tutorial I wrote titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/07/create-a-simple-restful-api-with-golang/\">Create a Simple RESTful API with Golang</a>, focuses on developing an API. However, I recently received questions on the subject of consuming data from other APIs from within a Go application.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re going to see how to issue HTTP requests from within Go, in an effort to consume or send data to other RESTful APIs that might exist on the internet.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/07/consume-restful-api-endpoints-golang-application/'>Consume RESTful API Endpoints Within A Golang Application</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n              ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/07/consume-restful-api-endpoints-golang-application/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
