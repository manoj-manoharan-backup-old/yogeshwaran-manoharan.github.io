The question is, how do you send emails from within your Android and iOS application without launching one of the already installed mail apps?  In other words how do you send emails via a custom form within the application or in the background?</p>\n<p>A solution to this question would be to use a backend web server that can send mail and create an API endpoint to it that can be accessed from your mobile app. However, this solution takes work and other resources. Instead you can make use of a transactional email service.</p>\n<p>There are many of these email services available, but for this example weâ€™re going to look at using the <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> service in a NativeScript application.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdevelop","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/04/send-emails-nativescript-app-via-mailgun-api/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
