[{"title":"CVE-2010-4258: Turning denial-of-service into privilege escalation","description":"Dan Rosenberg recently released a privilege escalation bug for Linux, based on three different kernel vulnerabilities I reported recently. This post is about CVE-2010-4258, the most interesting of them, and, as Dan writes, the reason he wrote the exploit in the first place. In it, I&rsquo;m going to do a brief tour of the various kernel features that collided to make this bug possible, and explain how they combine to turn an otherwise-boring oops into privilege escalation.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/12/cve-2010-4258-from-dos-to-privesc/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
