[{"title":"CockroachDB 2.1 is now 50x more scalable than Amazon Aurora","description":"[For CockroachDB&apos;s most up-to-date performance benchmarks, please read our Performance Overview page]\nCorrectness, stability, and performance are the foundations of CockroachDB. Today, we will demonstrate our rapid progress in performance and scalability with CockroachDB 2.1. CockroachDB is now 50x more scalable than Amazon Aurora at less than 2% of the price per tpmC. And unlike Aurora and other databases that selectively degrade isolation levels for performance, CockroachDB can achieve massive scale while maintaining serializable isolation, protecting your data from fraud and data loss.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-2dot1-performance/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"Evaluating ML Open Source","description":null,"link":"https://glennengstrand.info/blog/?p=476","owner":"Gleb Bahmutov"}]
