We knew that a key-value API was not the endpoint we wanted to provide and a few months ago started work on a higher level structured data API that would support tables and indexes.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/sql-in-cockroachdb-mapping-table-data-to-key-value-storage/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
