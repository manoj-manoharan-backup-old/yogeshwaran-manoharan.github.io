[{"title":"Alerting on SLOs like Pros","description":"If there is anything like a silver bullet for creating meaningful and actionable alerts with a high signal-to-noise ratio, it is alerting based on service-level objectives (SLOs). Fulfilling a well-defined SLO is the very definition of meeting your users’ expectations. Conversely, a certain level of service errors is OK as long as you stay within the SLO — in other words, if the SLO grants you an error budget. Burning through this error budget too quickly is the ultimate signal that some rectifying action is needed. The faster the budget is burned, the more urgent it is that engineers get involved. This post describes how we implemented this concept at SoundCloud, enabling us to fulfill our SLOs without flooding our engineers on call with an unsustainable amount of pages.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos","owner":"Soshace"},{"title":"Why We're Relicensing CockroachDB","description":"CockroachDB was conceived of as open source software. In the years since it first appeared on GitHub, we&#x2019;ve tread a relatively typical path in balancing open source with creating a viable business. We&#x2019;ve kept our core code under the Apache License version 2 (APL), launched a managed service, and gated some features for established companies under an enterprise license.\nBut our past outlook on the right business modelrelied on a crucial norm in the OSS world: that companies could build a business around a strong open source core product without a much larger technology platform company coming along and offering the same product as a service.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/","owner":"Cloudflare"}]
