[{"title":"Monthly Challenge: Functional Programming","description":"<p>Our topic for this month's <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/TrackMaven-Monthly-Challenge/\">Monthly Challenge meetup</a> is Functional Programming! In this post, we'll get you started with one of the many languages out there dedicated to functional programming: <a href=\"https://www.haskell.org/\">Haskell</a>! Here at TrackMaven, we write most of our code in Python and JavaScript, which are both capable of writing functional programming in their own right, but with the true spirit of our Monthly Challenges, I am going to write about a language that I am not super familiar with and see what we can do with it.</p>\n<h3>What is Functional Programming</h3>\n<p>But first, what is functional programming and why are we dedicating an entire Monthly Challenge to the topic? Functional Programming is the practices of writing code using solely functions avoiding both changing state and mutable data. <sup>[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\">1</a>]</sup> Having side-effect fr","link":"http://engineroom.trackmaven.com/blog/monthly-challenge-functional-programming/","owner":"TrackMaven"},{"title":"Postgresq error: type 'hstore' does not exist","description":"Today I was programming and messed up my database schema in such a way that I just wanted to restore a recent backup and start over from there.\ndropdb app_development createdb app_development Unfortunately I ran into an error:\n PostgreSQL error: type &lsquo;hstore&rsquo; does not exist\n hstore is a Postgresql extension (available since postgresql-9.x) that allows you store sets of key/value pairs within a single Postgresql value (read column).
