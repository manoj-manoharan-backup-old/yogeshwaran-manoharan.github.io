[{"title":"Announcing new Python SDK","description":"It’s no secret that SoundCloud is a Ruby shop, but that doesn’t stop us from giving some love to the Pythonistas in our community. Our old Python API wrapper has been neglected. It doesn’t support OAuth 2 or all of the resources made available by our API. It’s old and crufty and we’re sorry for letting it get that way. In order to make it up to you, we wrote a new one and made it much better.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/announcing-new-python-sdk","owner":"Soshace"}]
