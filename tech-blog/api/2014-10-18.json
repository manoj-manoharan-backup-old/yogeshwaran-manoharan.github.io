While functional, it lacks the robustness and safety that a production database requires. To add an additional layer of protection to our process, we ship our WAL files to S3 so that our replica can ALWAYS bring itself up to date regardless of an enormous write load on the primary or a temporary network disruption preventing the primary and replica from communicating with each other. </p>\n<p>We also create a base backup of our database nightly and send that to S3 so that we can restore our database to any point in time we need in case of catastrophe.
