As the name suggests, a decorator is something that decorates a function by adding extra behaviours. ‘<strong>@</strong>’ is used in Python for decorators.</p>\n\n<p>Let say you want to calculate the time a function takes to execute.

If a previous rehashing was interrupted in the middle or couldn’t finish for some reason, the file will still be there.
