[{"title":"Iâ€™m back in business!","description":"Ariejan.net is (almost) back in business. With some minor cosmetic improvements to the theme, I&rsquo;m ready for today.\nTomorrow I will reorganise my tags/categories a bit and add some new fancy plugins that will help searching visitors a hand in finding what they need. (More about that later, I promise).\nI hope you like the improved style of Ariejan.net. (If you don&rsquo;t, feel free to make a redesign and mail it to me.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/20/im-back-in-business/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Kabisa, RailsConf Europe and Ariejan.net","description":"Hello there! Just a quick post to let you know I&rsquo;m still alive and kicking! Two weeks ago I started my job at Kabisa and I&rsquo;ve been very busy with that. I really like working at Kabisa and we have some great things planned for the near future. (We&rsquo;re currently working on a few client projects that need our attention.)\nI&rsquo;d also like to let you know that I&rsquo;ll be attending RailsConf Europe 2007 this year!","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/20/kabisa-railsconf-europe-and-ariejannet/","owner":"Antirez"}]
