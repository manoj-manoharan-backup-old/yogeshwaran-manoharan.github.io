[{"title":"Using Backbone JS in multipage application","description":"Recently we worked on a cloud resouces management application written on rails for one of our clients. Think about this app as GUI for Amazon AWS. All the resources will be displayed in tabular form and ajax requests for management like creation, updation and deletion of resources. Soon application became more complex because of lots of server side javascript code directly interacting with DOM. As a result testing became more complex, DOM changes used to break javascript code, and tests used to break often.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-04-06-backbone/","owner":"Codelitt"}]
