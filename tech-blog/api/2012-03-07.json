[{"title":"Moving API Support to Stack Overflow","description":"The SoundCloud Developer Community has grown immensely. We have over ten thousand registered applications and over three hundred showcased in our App Gallery. Our goal as the Platform Team is to provide the best API tools possible, while also providing support and inspiration. So far, our primary channels have been this blog, our Twitter account, and our mailing list, hosted on Google Groups. In the coming months, you can expect some changes as we retool to accommodate the growth of our developer community. We are revisiting everything and doubling down on our efforts to provide the best, most accessible platform possible for building amazing applications that use sound in exciting new ways on the web.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/moving-api-support-to-stack-overflow","owner":"Soshace"}]
