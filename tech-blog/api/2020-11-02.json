The technique used for circumventing WDAC was originally discovered by Lee Christensen, however, it was not previously disclosed like a handful of others on the Microsoft Recommended Block Rules list.

Either there&rsquo;s incomplete data, missing tracking data, duplicative tracking data. - DJ Patil\nI spend a lot of my time digging into data at various companies. Most of the time I’m surprised by what I see and so are the engineers and analysts that work at these companies.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/11/python-pandas-first-contact-with-data.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
