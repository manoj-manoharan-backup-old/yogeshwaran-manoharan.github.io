[{"title":"Visual Studio and ProjectTypeGuids.cs","description":"<p>It&rsquo;s a story about how I tried to open a project in Visual Studio for a few hours. The other day, I was going to do some work. I pulled last commits from a repo, opened Visual Studio, and prepared to start coding. However, one of a project in my solution failed to open with a strange message:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\">error : The operation could not be completed.\n</code></pre></div><p>In the Solution Explorer, I had <em>&ldquo;load failed&rdquo;</em> as a project status and the following message instead of the file tree: <em>&ldquo;The project requires user input. Reload the project for more information.&quot;</em> Hmm, ok, I reloaded the project and got a few more errors:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\">error : The operation could not be completed.\nerror : The operation could not be completed.\n</code></pre></div>","link":"https://aakinshin.net/posts/projecttypeguids/","owner":"Andrew Ray"}]
