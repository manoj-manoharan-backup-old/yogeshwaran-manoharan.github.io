[{"title":"oEmbed support for the new HTML5 widget","description":"Today we’ve added support for our new HTML5 widget to the oEmbed endpoint. Aside from a brand new user interface with lots of improvements, the HTML5 widget doesn’t require Adobe Flash anymore. That means the widget will load much faster and finally work well on most mobile platforms, including Android & iOS. And we won’t stop here. We’ll continue to improve the new widget in the coming months.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/oembed-support-for-the-html5-widget","owner":"Soshace"}]
