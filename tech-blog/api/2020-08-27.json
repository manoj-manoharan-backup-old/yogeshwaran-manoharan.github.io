Here is What We Learned.","description":"On April 2, 2019 Intel Optane Persistent Memory became the first \r\ncommercially available storage class memory (SCM). SCM is a storage device \r\nthat sits on a memory bus; in contrast, traditional storage devices like \r\nSSD are attached to the PCIe bus. We were interested how SCM, being much \r\ncloser to the CPU, affects performance of real applications. We compared \r\nthe performance of MongoDBâ€™s storage engine WiredTiger on two Optane \r\nstorage devices: one packaged as SCM and another one packaged as SSD. \r\nAlthough these devices deliver vastly different performance when accessed \r\nin a raw form, their performance under the entire software stack, including \r\nOS, file system and the application, is not that different, because \r\nin-memory caches effectively mask latency.","link":"https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/we-replaced-an-ssd-with-storage-class-memory-here-is-what-we-learned","owner":"Mixpanel"}]
