[{"title":"Functions and Naked Returns In Go","description":"In Go values that are returned from functions are passed by value. Go gives you some nice flexibility when it comes to returning values from a function.\nHere is a simple example of returning two values from a function:\npackage main\nimport (\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;fmt&quot;\n)\nfunc main() {\n&nbsp; &nbsp;id, err := ReturnId()\n&nbsp; &nbsp;if err != nil {\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fmt.Printf(&quot;ERROR: %s&quot;, err)\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return\n&nbsp; &nbsp;}","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/10/functions-and-naked-returns-in-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
