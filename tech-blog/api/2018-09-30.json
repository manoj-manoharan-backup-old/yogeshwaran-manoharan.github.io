[{"title":"Analyzing a simple encryption scheme using GitHub SSH keys","description":"<p>(This is an introductory level analysis of a scheme involving RSA. If you&rsquo;re already comfortable with Bleichenbacher oracles you should skip it.)</p>\n\n<p>Someone pointed me at the following suggestion on the Internet for encrypting secrets to people based on their GitHub SSH keys. I like the idea of making it easier for people to leverage key material and tools they already have.  The encryption instructions are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo &quot;my secret&quot; &gt; message.txt\ncurl -q github.com/$USER.keys | head -n 1 &gt; recipient.pub\nssh-keygen -e -m pkcs8 -f recipient.pub &gt; recipient.pem\nopenssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey recipient.pem -ssl \\\n    -in message.txt -out encrypted.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anything using an openssl command line tool makes me a little uncomfortable. Let&rsquo;s poke at it a little.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll assume that that first key is really an RSA key and we don&rsquo;t have to worry about EdDSA or ECDSA (or heaven forbid, DSA).
