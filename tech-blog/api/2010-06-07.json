[{"title":"Confessions of a programmer: I hate code review","description":"Most of the projects I've been working on today have fairly strict code review policies. My work requires code review on most of our code, and as we bring on an army of interns for the summer, I've been responsible for reviewing lots of code. Additionally, about five months ago BarnOwl, the console-based IM client I develop, adopted an official pre-commit review policy. And I have a confession to make: I hate mandatory code review.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/06/i-hate-code-review/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"},{"title":"Uploading files with Curl","description":"I&rsquo;ve always trouble uploading files with Curl. Some how the syntax for that command won&rsquo;t stick, so I post it here for future reference.\nWhat I want to do is perform a normal POST, including a file and some other variables to a remote server. This is it:\ncurl -i -F name=test -F filedata=@localfile.jpg http://example.org/upload You can add as many -F as you want. The -i option tells curl to show the response headers as well, which I find useful most of the time.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/06/07/uploading-files-with-curl/","owner":"Antirez"}]
