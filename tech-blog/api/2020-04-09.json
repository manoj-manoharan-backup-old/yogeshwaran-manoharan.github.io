[{"title":"CuPy accelerates NumPy on the GPU? Hold my Cider, here's Clojure!","description":"<p>\nEveryone knows that Python's <a href=\"https://numpy.org\">NumPy</a> is fast due to its C++ based native backends.\nPower users even know that Nvidia provides a drop-in replacement, <a href=\"https://github.com/cupy/cupy\">CuPy</a>, that brings\nthe power of GPU acceleration. Everyone knew that there was no airplane faster than\nMesserschmitt Me 163, but that was good information in 1944. Everyone knows that Java\nis slow and Clojure is not a great choice for number crunching, but as soon as I dig\nanywhere with my software, I discover that the folk wisdom is terribly wrong, and that\nClojure kicks ass on CPU <i>and especially on the GPU</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere's summary, or, if you prefer, a TL;DR: I compared NumPy's <code>corrcoef</code> function\nwith a simple 7-liner that I wrote as a demonstration for my book <a href=\"https://aiprobook.com/numerical-linear-algebra-for-programmers\">Numerical Linear Algebra for Programmers</a>.\nThe times for computing <code>corrcoef</code> for a \\(1000\\times{1","link":"http://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Clojure-Numpy-Cupy-CPU-GPU","owner":"Dragan Djuric"},{"title":"The Unfriendly Robot: Automatically flagging unwelcoming comments","description":null,"link":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/09/the-unfriendly-robot-automatically-flagging-unwelcoming-comments/","owner":"Stack Overflow"}]
