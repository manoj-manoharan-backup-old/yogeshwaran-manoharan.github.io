This meant that all attributes required for making a decision on whether each payment transaction is legitimate or fraudulent relied solely upon the availability of supporting data in production. Another approach to fraud detection was to run various queries on BigQuery, which is our data warehouse, to identify specific patterns (or signals) and send the results to risk analysts who were interested in the output. The analysts would manually go through the results and then possibly recommend if these data points could be applied in production to live payment traffic to fight fraud. This approach had its shortcomings because it did not really stop payments from going through in case of fraud as there was a significant delay in propagating and applying the newly found data points to the payment transactions in productio","link":"https://wecode.wepay.com/posts/an-offline-to-online-data-pipeline-at-wepay","owner":"WePay"},{"title":"Angular Services, providedIn and Lazy Modules","description":"<div class=\"article-intro\">\r\n    I often see people confused about how the DI works, in particular with lazy loaded modules.
