[{"title":"Introducing go-health","description":"Today, InVision is excited to introduce go-health â€” the scalable health checking library for Golang services. go-health is designed to help developers set up Kubernetes health check probes that are safe from DoS attacks and scalable for large deployments.\nThe challenge Kubernetes has two kinds of health check probes: liveness probes and readiness probes. Readiness probes signal to the kubelet agent that a pod can begin handling traffic. When a readiness probe is defined, traffic will only reach a pod after a 2xx status response is received from the readiness probe endpoint.","link":"https://engineering.invisionapp.com/post/go-health-scalable-checks-for-kubernetes/","owner":"Intuit"},{"title":"vThinking Aloud: Publish Content Library to S3 for Cross-Region/Cross-Account Replication","description":"What if you could publish your Content Library directly to AWS S3 and then Cross-Region Replicate it for better availability?
