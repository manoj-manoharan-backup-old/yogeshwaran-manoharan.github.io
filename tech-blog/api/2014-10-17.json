[{"title":"Aggregating Apache logs with Fluentd and Amazon S3","description":"\n<p>HackerEarth infrastructure is hosted on Amazon services. At any given point of time many\nwebservers are running concurrently serving thousands of requests. This\ngenerates tons of access and error logs on each server separately. The task\nhere was to  parse the logs on all these webservers and store them at one place\nin a format that can further be used to derive meaningful insights from the\ndata. We tried to accomplish this using fluentd and Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p>####Mechanism</p>\n\n<p>Fluentd does the following things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Continuously tails apache log files.</li>\n  <li>Parses incoming entries into meaning fields like ip, address etc and buffers them.</li>\n  <li>Writes the buffered data to Amazon S3 periodically.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>####Installation\nThe stable version of fluentd is called td-agent and we are using the same for\nour purpose here.\nFor ubuntu 12.04 LTS the following shell command will install td-agent on your\nsystem.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlight","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2014/10/17/using-fluentd/","owner":"Gusto"}]
