[{"title":"How to write a Rails Plugin (for controllers)","description":"A few days back I posted my very first Rails plugin, Acts As Exportable. Although writing a plugin is rather easy, you must know a few tricks on how to get things going.\nThis article will show you how to develop a plugin that adds functionality to a controller (other plugins, e.g. for models) will follow later. In fact, I&rsquo;ll explain to you how I developed my Acts As Exportable plugin.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/07/06/how-to-write-a-rails-plugin-for-controllers/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Some DNS problems with Ariejan.net","description":"This is just a quick note to let you know there are currently some issues with DNS for Ariejan.net. This basically means that Trac and SVN are currently not available. I&rsquo;ve made the appropriate changes and things should be working again in a few hours.\nI&rsquo;m very sorry for the inconvenience.\nUpdate: It appears that things are working again. If you have any issues with Trac, please let me know.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/07/06/some-dns-problems-with-ariejannet/","owner":"Antirez"}]
