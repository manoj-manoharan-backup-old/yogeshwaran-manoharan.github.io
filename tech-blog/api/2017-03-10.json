Since then, I have distributed just over 1800 copies, for a gross revenue of $220,033.50 (about $1000/week). Although I launched the course in March, I had worked on it for about 4 months. Releasing the course has been a lifechanging event for me. For the first time ever, I made more money over a year from product revenue rather than service revenue. Releasing the course nearly doubled my usual freelancing rate, allowed me to change my lifestyle by moving to a ski resort town in New Mexico, and turned me into something of a minor Thought Leader (tm) in the Ruby on Rails field.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I&","link":"https://www.nateberkopec.com/blog/2017/03/10/how-i-made-self-publishing-about-ruby-on-rails.html","owner":"NSHipster"},{"title":"JWT Authentication In A Node.js Powered API","description":"\n                    <p>When it comes to API development, there is often a need to protect certain endpoints or rate-limit the API in general. Because you are working with endpoints from clients possibly on a different domain, you can’t authenticate users with sessions and cookies. It would also be a bad idea to pass around a username and password with each request. Typically endpoints are protected with tokens that are passed with each request and these tokens are often JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that work very well.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to create a very simple API using Node.js with protected endpoints that require a valid JWT in order for requests to succeed.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/jwt-authentication-in-a-node-js-powered-api/'>JWT Authentication In A Node.js Powered API</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Develope","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/jwt-authentication-in-a-node-js-powered-api/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Overriding Swift Protocol Extension Default Implementations","description":"","link":"https://team.goodeggs.com/overriding-swift-protocol-extension-default-implementations-d005a4428bda?source=rss----a8c29e7e4c47---4","owner":"GoCardless"},{"title":"Password Rules Are Bullshit","description":"kg-card-begin: markdown","link":"https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/","owner":"Jay Fields"}]
