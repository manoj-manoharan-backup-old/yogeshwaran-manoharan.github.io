[{"title":"Exploiting misuse of Python's \"pickle\"","description":"If you program in Python, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the pickle serialization library, which provides for efficient binary serialization and loading of Python datatypes. Hopefully, you&rsquo;re also familiar with the warning printed prominently near the start of pickle's documentation:\n Warning: The pickle module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.\n Recently, however, I stumbled upon a project that was accepting and unpacking untrusted pickles over the network, and a poll of some friends revealed that few of them were aware of just how easy it is to exploit a service that does this.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
