Author &amp; founder of <a href=\"http://www.bangdb.com/\">BangDB</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p>This article is to simply report the YCSB bench test results in detail for five NoSQL databases namely Redis, MongoDB, Couchbase, Yugabyte and BangDB and compare the result side by side. I have used latest versions for each NoSQL DB and have followed the recommendations to run all the databases in optimized conditions. I have also used the default six test scenarios as defined by the YCSB framework. I have restricted it to 10M records for each test. However, user can run the bench for as many numbers as they practically find suitable.</p>\r\n<h2>About YCSB</h2>\r\n<p>Following configurations were used for the evaluation purpose.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Redis Server: 5.07, x86/64 </li>\r\n<li>MongoDB server: 4.4.2, x86_64 </li>\r\n<li>YugabyteDB:2.5.0, x86_64 </li>","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HighScalability/~3/V1UBTQoHi70/benchmark-ycsb-numbers-for-redis-mongodb-couchbase2-yugabyte.html","owner":"High Scalability"},{"title":"Build Real-World React Native App #11 : Pay For Remove Ads","description":null,"link":"https://soshace.com/build-real-world-react-native-app-11-pay-for-remove-ads/","owner":"Soshace"},{"title":"Cloudera DataFlow’s key milestones and wins in 2020","description":null,"link":"https://blog.cloudera.com/cloudera-dataflows-key-milestones-and-wins-in-2020/","owner":"Cloudera"},{"title":"Common Chunk and Lazy Loading in Angular","description":"<div class=\"article-intro\">\r\n    Since I get this question often, why not write it down!
