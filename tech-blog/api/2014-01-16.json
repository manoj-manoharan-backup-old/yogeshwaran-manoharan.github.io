[{"title":"Be Selected To Attend GopherCon 2014","description":"Gopher Academy announced a great program today.\nToday I&rsquo;d like to announce the GopherCon Scholarship Program. It&rsquo;s goal is to increase the visibility of women in the Go community through the most direct path I can imagine: sponsoring their attendance to GopherCon 2014.\nThe program works by you purchasing one of these special tickets. There will be a selection/nomination process and those woman selected will be able to attend GopherCon thanks to you.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/01/gophercon-2014-scholarship-for-women.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"},{"title":"Go Package Management For 2014","description":"Introduction\nIn October 2013 I sent out a call to action to the Go community. I wanted to form a group of Gophers that would come together and help write a specification and build a working implementation of a package management tool. We are not there yet, but the group did accomplish a few things:\nWe started a mailing list called Go package management [go-pm] where people could discuss ideas and get feedback on existing and new tools.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/01/go-package-management-for-2014.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
