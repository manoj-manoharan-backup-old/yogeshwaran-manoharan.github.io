[{"title":"100,000 strong - CodeFactory server","description":"\n<p><strong>The Inception</strong></p>\n\n<p>January 2012 was an idyllic time for us. Three of us had just teamed up <a href=\"http://prakashvivek.blogspot.in/2012/11/you-can-do-startup-you-cant-tell-girl.html\">to build\nsomething\ncool</a>. \nThere was no planning for the future, no sort of agreement - we\nwere just three geeks sitting in the dorm room who wanted to build a product.\nWe started working on <a href=\"http://learn.hackerearth.com\">MyCareerStack</a> where there\nwas supposed to be interview questions, tutorials etc. Soon, we realized that\nthere was code editor needed, but that was easy. The harder part was that\npeople donâ€™t only want to write code online, they want to run them. Now that I\nhad never done before!</p>\n\n<p>What resulted then was a hacky few hundred lines of code in C, which could\ncompile and run code in just C, C++ and Java. It might have been even the worst\npiece of code I had ever written, but it worked and it was sweet!</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code clas","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/03/12/100000-strong/","owner":"Gusto"}]
