[{"title":"ActiveScaffold + acts_as_taggable + Auto Complete","description":"I&rsquo;ve talked before on how to use ActiveScaffold with acts_as_taggable_on_steroids.\nThe problem with that solution was that, although the checkboxes for every tag are very nice, you couldn&rsquo;t easily add new tags. For some people, this may be fine, for others, it is not.\nTogether with a colleague (who wishes not to be named), I found a solution that is quite elegant. Instead of using check boxes, and creating all kinds of subforms in ActiveScaffold, we opted for an auto_completing, comma-separated list of tags.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/07/01/activescaffold-acts_as_taggable-auto-complete/","owner":"Antirez"}]
