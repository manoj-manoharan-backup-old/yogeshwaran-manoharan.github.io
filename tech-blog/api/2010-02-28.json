[{"title":"A Very Subtle Bug","description":"6.033, MIT&rsquo;s class on computer systems, has as one of its catchphrases, &ldquo;Complex systems fail for complex reasons&rdquo;. As a class about designing and building complex systems, it&rsquo;s a reminder that failure modes are subtle and often involve strange interactions between multiple parts of a system. In my own experience, I&rsquo;ve concluded that they&rsquo;re often wrong. I like to say that complex systems don&rsquo;t usually fail for complex reasons, but for the simplest, dumbest possible reasons &ndash; there are just more available dumb reasons.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/02/a-very-subtle-bug/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
