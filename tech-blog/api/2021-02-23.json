If an object fails, it is replaced. To deliver new software, objects are replaced while still in motion.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/kubernetes-orchestrate-sql-with-cockroachdb/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"A Fabulous February Firefox — 86!","description":null,"link":"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/a-fabulous-february-firefox-86/","owner":"Mozilla Hacks"},{"title":"A New Front in the War for Automotive Talent","description":"Technology is dramatically changing how people use cars.
