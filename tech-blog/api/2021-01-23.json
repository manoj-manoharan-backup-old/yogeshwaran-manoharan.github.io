After watching this movie for the n-teenth time, I have a strong urge to also have robotic arms in a workshop like Tony Stark. You can see the value of the robots clearly throughout the movie.

As a bit of a thought experiment, I considered what it would take to get the same functionality in reality. What this ends up leading to is a configuration management system for manufacturing, much like a build system.

You can add different components like cameras or sensors and program all the functionality you need for your specific use case.
