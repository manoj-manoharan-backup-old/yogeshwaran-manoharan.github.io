[{"title":"Super Simple Authentication Plugin and Generator","description":"I hereby proudly announce my Super Simple Authentication plugin and generator.\nAll right, what does it do? Sometimes you need to protect your actions and controllers, but you don&rsquo;t want to go about installing restful_authentication or anything like that. Adding a simple password for certain actions would suffice. So, I wrote a little plugin that can generate some code for you that allows you to easily protect your app with a simple password.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/24/super-simple-authentication-plugin-and-generator/","owner":"Antirez"}]
