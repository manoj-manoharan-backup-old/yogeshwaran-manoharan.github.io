[{"title":"Hassle-free automated assessments","description":"\n<p>Our older test creation flow had several inherent problems associated with it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Profile driven</strong><br />Earlier to this, we had test creation based on job profiles (role-based), which was restrictive as the skills were tightly coupled to the roles and were not customizable by the recruiters. For example, I could select a profile say front-end engineer and the questions generated will only be from HTML, CSS and Javascript. So, if a recruiter wanted to generate questions for a front-end engineer profile to test <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">React</code> skill, they had to add them manually from our questions library or theirs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Complex UI</strong><br />The older interface was filled with unwanted form elements and had almost no provision to support newer question types. We somehow missed to provide a scalable and an intuitive step-by-step test creation flow that catered to the needs of our non-technical recruiters.</p>\n\n<p","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2020/02/02/hassle-free-automated-assessments/","owner":"HackerEarth"}]
