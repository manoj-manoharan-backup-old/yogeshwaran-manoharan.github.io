Switched from Amazon Aurora to CockroachDB","description":"With millions of customers to serve, a major cable company needed to build a virtual customer support agent to scale their customer requests. The app had to provide 24/7 help to users across the United States, and store metadata about customer conversations.\nThe first version of the application was built on Amazon Aurora, in a single cloud region on the east coast of the United States. However, this deployment was vulnerable to failures, and when a networking failure in an AWS region knocked the entire service offline, the team realized that Aurora’s single-master architecture was not sufficient to attain the always-on customer experience they wanted.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/the-multi-region-cockroachdb-deployment-powering-a-telecom-providers-24-7-support-platform/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
