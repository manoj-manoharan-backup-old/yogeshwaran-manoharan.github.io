His code needed to do something <em>different</em>, depending on whether the objects were &#34;active&#34; or not, but fortunately, there was a handy-dandy <code>IsActive</code> method. <em>Weirdly</em>, that method required a <code>bool</code> parameter, but also returned a <code>bool</code>. Since there wasn&#39;t any useful documentation, Cornelius checked the C++ code.</p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-cplusplus\"><code><div>    bool SomeActivatedClass::IsActive(bool&amp; active)\r\n    {\r\n        active = true;\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n</div></code></code></pre>\r\n<p>This method leaves the choice of whether or not the object <code>IsActive</code> up to the caller. If you check the value in the pass-by-reference parameter, it will <em>always</em> be <code>true</code>.

As with other Red Hat products, users have to acquire subscriptions, which are priced according to the number of cores or vCPU used to deploy the product.</p>\n\n<p>This presents an interesting problem for pre-sales engineers like me. To help my customers acquire the correct number of subscriptions, I need to sketch the target architecture and count how many cores they need. This would not be a problem if off-the-shelf performance benchmarks were available; however, they are not.</p>\n\n<p>This article will help colleagues and customers estimate their SSO projects more precisely. We will examine the performance benchmarks I ran, how I designed them, the results I gathered, an","link":"https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/07/how-size-your-projects-red-hats-single-sign-technology","owner":"Red Hat"},{"title":"Nearshoring in DACH – trends and predictions","description":"Digitalisation and globalisation are increasingly forcing the optimisation of conventional corporate management strategies.
