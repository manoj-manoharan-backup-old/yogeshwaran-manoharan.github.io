[{"title":"Distributed ID generation with Redis and Lua","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR: We are open-sourcing our distributed <em>k</em>-sortable ID generation project called “Icicle”, which generates IDs using Lua scripting within distributed Redis hosts. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/intenthq/icicle\">find more information in the GitHub repository</a>!</strong></p>\n\n<p>At Intent HQ, we generate a lot of data. Part of the task of capturing this data is to package it up into a common format and store it in a way it can be retrieved. Commonly, labelling this data in a way that facilitates retrieval is a task handled by your database. However, in a big data environment, we need a way to label these pieces of data with an ID in a distributed and scalable way independent of a database.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of this article, we’ll walk you through how we arrived at a solution for generating IDs in a distributed fashion using the Redis instances we already had deployed and in a format that allows <em>k</em>-ordering. We’ll share with you the code for doi","link":"http://engineering.intenthq.com/2015/03/icicle-distributed-id-generation-with-redis-lua/","owner":"Intel"},{"title":"List of Modules loaded","description":"While working on the .NET Loader and now in Bing where I am right now working on some features...","link":"https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/abhinaba/list-of-modules-loaded","owner":"Aaron Patterson"}]
