[{"title":"Detect browser Web Sockets support","description":"HTML5 Web Sockets are awesome! I&rsquo;ve been toying around with it for a bit today and noticed that not every browser supports native HTML5 Web Sockets yet.\nGoogle Chrome 5 has native support for web sockets, FireFox 3.6 does not. This poses a problem if you&rsquo;re building something awesome that does require web sockets. ~\nLuckily, it&rsquo;s easy to detect web sockets support through JavaScript. All you really need to do is check if WebSocket is defined or not.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/04/05/detect-browser-web-sockets-support/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Some thoughts on Quora","description":"With the announcement this week that Quora had taken $11 million in VC at an $86 million valuation, there&rsquo;s been an awful lot of attention on Quora. I&rsquo;ve had an account there and wanted to write up some of my initial thoughts.\nIf you haven&rsquo;t heard about Quora, it&rsquo;s yet another question/answer site on the web. People pose questions, and you can view questions and answer them. I&rsquo;ve heard it described as &ldquo;StackOverflow, but for anything&rdquo;, which is roughly true, even if I think they want to be more.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/04/some-thoughts-on-quora/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
