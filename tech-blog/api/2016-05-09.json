[{"title":"Add Type Definitions To An External JavaScript File In TypeScript","description":"\n                    <p>Not too long ago I wrote an article that explained how to <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/01/include-external-javascript-libraries-in-an-angular-2-typescript-project/\">include external JavaScript libraries in an Angular TypeScript project</a>. To summarize that post, my goal was to show how to use any of the millions of JavaScript libraries that exist online within a TypeScript application. I received a lot of heat from that article saying that I am missing the point of TypeScript because in the end I wasn’t using any type definitions. I disagree because not every library that exists on the internet will have a set of type definitions. In that sense the article still proves very useful.</p>\n<p>This time around, I want to explain how to include type definitions in your project, should they exist. I won’t be going over the entire Angular demo again, but the JavaScript library will be the same and it will still be a functional application.</p>\n  ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/05/add-type-definitions-external-javascript-library-typescript/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
