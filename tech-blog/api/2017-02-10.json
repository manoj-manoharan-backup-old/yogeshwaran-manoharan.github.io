This lightweight software was written with Golang and accomplishes similar things to that of Amazon S3. After all they are both object storage solutions. The difference here is that Minio can be deployed on your own hardware.</p>\n<p>Being that Minio was written with Golang, it is cross platform for different computing architectures, ARM included. This means that the server software can be installed on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01CD5VC92&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nraboy-20&amp;linkId=d3cd38495263498754bcbd2a05018615\">Raspberry Pi</a> micro computing devices. Object storage is great for data backups so it gave me the idea to turn my Raspberry Pi into an object storage backup solution.</p>\n                    \n           ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/using-raspberry-pi-distributed-object-storage-minio/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
