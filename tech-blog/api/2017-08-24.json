The interviewing process is unconventional by design---especially for non-engineering positions. The interviews are exercise-based, focused on practical, day-in-the-life style work tasks. Additionally, resumes are removed from the process to fight unconscious bias. The process is crafted thoughtfully and customized for each role being hired for, but it can be a bit daunting for candidates who are used to traditional interviews. As someone who recently experienced the process first-hand, I thought it would be beneficial for potential candidates to hear about my interviewing experience and gain insight into the process.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/navigating-tech-writer/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"Unit Testing a Node.js Application with the Jasmine Testing Framework","description":"\n                    <p>When building an application, regardless if it is mobile, web, or neither, it is a good idea to come up with a collection of tests that can be used in a continuous integration scenario. I must admit, I don’t have the best habits when it comes to writing tests, but I’m sure my applications would be significantly better if I did.</p>\n<p>Previously I had written about <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/unit-testing-golang-application-includes-http/\">unit testing in Golang</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/unit-testing-nativescript-angular-2-android-ios-mobile-application/\">unit testing in NativeScript with Angular</a>. This time around it makes sense to talk about writing tests in Node.js, another technology that I have in my tool belt.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/08/unit-testing-node-js-application-jasmine-testing","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/08/unit-testing-node-js-application-jasmine-testing-framework/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
