[{"title":"HackerEarth API v2: Introducing asynchronous callbacks","description":"\n<p>We had already published HackerEarth API v1 in February, 2012 at\n<a href=\"http://developer.hackerearth.com\">http://developer.hackerearth.com</a>.\nThe API v1 was synchronous\nin nature. This means that your request kept hanging until the\ncode evaluation was done and response was received. This seriously\nlimited anyone from writing robust applications using the API.</p>\n\n<p>We have been using the <em>asynchronous API</em> for a long time ourselves\nat HackerEarth for processing all the code submissions. It’s fast,\nit’s robust and works flawlessly. Today, we are making the async\nAPI public.</p>\n\n<p>There is not a major change in the way API request is done, if you have\nalready checked out the synchronous API v1. Now, you\nget a confirmation response as soon as you do the request. The actual response\ncontaining the code evaluation data arrives later at the callback as\nPOST data, with the response contained in ‘payload’ POST parameter.\nThe response format is always same and in JSON format.","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/09/09/hackerearth-api-v2-asynchronous-callbacks/","owner":"Gusto"},{"title":"Writing your own Karma adapter","description":"Background When we started to work on the new version of our mobile web app, we knew we wanted to run unit tests on a wide variety of…","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/writing-your-own-karma-adapter","owner":"Soshace"}]
