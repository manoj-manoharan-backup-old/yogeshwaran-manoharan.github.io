[{"title":"Getting carried away with hack value","description":"Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on some BarnOwl branches that move more of the core functionality of BarnOwl into perl code, instead of C (BarnOwl is written in an unholy mix of C and perl code that call each other back and forth obsessively).\nMoving code into perl has many advantages, but one problem is speed &ndash; perl code is obvious a lot slower than C, and BarnOwl has a lot of hot spots related to its tendency to keep tens or hundreds of thousands of messages in memory and loop over all of them in response to various commands.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/05/hack-value/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
