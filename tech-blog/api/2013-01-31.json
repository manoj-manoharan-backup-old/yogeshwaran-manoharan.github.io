[{"title":"Data- & Aria- Attribute Support Added to XHP","description":"<p>Last night I added <code>data-</code> and <code>aria-</code> attribute support into XHP. I baked it into <code>:x:composable-element</code> directly instead of relying on previous methods which only added it to <code>:xhp:html-element</code>. I did this for a few reasons. First, I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of <code>getAttribute()</code> and <code>setAttribute()</code> not being final within <code>:x:primitive</code>.
