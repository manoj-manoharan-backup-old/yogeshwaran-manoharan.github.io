[{"title":"The Power of Headless Chrome and PWA Automation Using Puppeteer","description":"Testing code is critical for the maintainability of a complex code base, but it is just as important that tests are easy to write, maintain, and understand. Frontend code is no exception to this rule, and behaviors that live in your UI should be tested as well. Historically, testing UI has been hard to accomplish for a variety of reasons, but using React removes a lot of these hurdles. We hope that puppeteer does a good job of removing the remaining ones! The love Story of Puppeteer Before we start, let’s define Puppeteer. Puppeteer is a node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol, It goes on to say Puppeteer runs headless Chrome or Chromium instances by default, which is why they’re always mentioned in tandem. Puppeteer was made for Chrome by Google Chrome DevTools team to help further automated/headless browser testing and make it less painful.Low-level emulation is usually done with DevTools protocol. Just like the Chrome Dev","link":"https://engineering.opensooq.com/the-power-of-headless-chrome-and-pwa-automation-using-puppeteer/","owner":"Oyster"}]
