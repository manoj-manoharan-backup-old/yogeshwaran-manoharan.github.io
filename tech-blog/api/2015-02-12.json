[{"title":"Contributing To A Git Repository on GitHub","description":"\n                    <p>Recently I’ve been contributing a lot of code to open source projects on GitHub. In particular, I’ve been contributing to the AngularJS extension set, <a href=\"http://www.ngcordova.com/\">ngCordova</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a>. When I first started contributing it was a scary process, mostly because I had only ever used Git for solo projects. I have used it for team projects, but for the majority it was my own personal projects.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll see how to contribute to an already existing, open source project on GitHub.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/02/contributing-git-repository-github/'>Contributing To A Git Repository on GitHub</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/02/contributing-git-repository-github/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Feature Spotlight: Polls & Surveys","description":"<img src=\"/images/feature_surveys_and_polls_in_email.png\" alt=\"Polls and Surveys in Mixmax\">\n\n<p>Mixmax Polls and Surveys make it easy to get quick, direct, and structured replies back from your recipients.</p>\n\n<p>Polls enable you to ask a question and have the recipients pick one option among several.
