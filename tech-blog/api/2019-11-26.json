[{"title":"Availability and Region Failure: Joint Consensus in CockroachDB","description":"At Cockroach Labs, we write quite a bitabout consensus algorithms. They are a critical component of CockroachDB and we rely on them in the lower layers of our transactional, scalable, distributed key-value store. In fact, large clusters can contain tens of thousands of consensus groups because in CockroachDB, every Range (similar to a shard) is an independent consensus group. Under the hood, we run a large number of instances of Raft(a consensus algorithm), which has come with interesting engineering challenges.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/joint-consensus-raft/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"New Lambda Features - Pre-re:Invent - Nov. 2019","description":"AWS recently announced several new features for Lambda that you might want to take advantage of.","link":"https://serverless.com/blog/november-2019-lambda-releases/","owner":"Sensible"},{"title":"Podcast: TFW You Accidentally Delete Your  Database","description":null,"link":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/25/podcast-tfw-you-accidentally-delete-your-database/","owner":"Squarespace"},{"title":"Powered by AI: Instagram’s Explore recommender system","description":null,"link":"https://instagram-engineering.com/powered-by-ai-instagrams-explore-recommender-system-7ca901d2a882?source=rss----37dc2a3034f2---4","owner":"Instacart"},{"title":"Using SQLAlchemy to access MySQL without frustrating library installation issues","description":"This is more a ‘note to myself’ than anything else, but I expect some other people might find it useful. I’ve often struggled with accessing MySQL from Python, as the ‘default’ MySQL library for Python is MySQLdb. This library has a number of problems: 1) it is Python 2 only, and 2) it requires compiling […]","link":"http://blog.rtwilson.com/using-sqlalchemy-to-access-mysql-without-frustrating-library-installation-issues/","owner":"Robin Ward"}]
