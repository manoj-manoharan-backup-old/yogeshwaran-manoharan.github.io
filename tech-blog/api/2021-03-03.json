That won’t happen to anyone using our smart home products. Levven had been in the electronics manufacturing industry for decades before “smart technology” paved the way for “smart homes”. When that happened we saw an opportunity to help make homes more affordable by designing and manufacturing smart home controls that reduce build costs. By eliminating the wire between the wall switch and the light we can offer consumers more eco-friendly home construction saving precious resources.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/resilient-smart-appliances/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"MailTrackerBlocker","description":"One thing that has annoyed me about receiving email is so-called tracker pixels. These usually 1x1px transparent images that are remotely loaded into HTML email enable the sender to track information about be. A good resource about them is No To Spy Pixels. As such I've tended to run my email clients with remote resource loading disabled, which isn't the best experience as a surprising number of legitimate email even display the call-to-action link as… ","link":"https://akrabat.com/mailtrackerblocker/","owner":"Rob Allen"},{"title":"MapTiler Desktop 11 with enhanced UX","description":"\n          <img src=\"https://www.maptiler.com/media/2021-03-03-maptiler-desktop-11-with-enhanced-ux-1.png\"\n          alt=\"Thumb\">\n          <p>After a year of heavy development, we release the 11th version of our data-into-maps converting software <a href=\"/desktop/\">MapTiler Desktop</a>.

Even though we have PHP 8, JIT, and all other improvements, people still continue complaining about PHP. That it is a language only for the request-response circle. That PHP is very slow and cannot be used in high-load systems. On the one hand yes, it is true. If we want to build something really performant – the classic blocking PHP is not the right choice.
