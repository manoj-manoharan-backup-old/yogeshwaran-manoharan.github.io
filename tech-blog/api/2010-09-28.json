[{"title":"Precompile SASS to CSS for deployment to Heroku","description":"If you have deployed apps to Heroku you know that you cannot write to the read-only file system that Heroku offers. For file uploads you have to use some storage provider like Amazon S3 or RackSpace CloudFiles.\nNow, if your application (I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re already on Rails 3), is using Haml + Sass, you&rsquo;re in some trouble. Sass is set to generate CSS files on the fly and save them to public/stylesheets so the can be served like static content.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/09/28/precompile-sass-to-css-for-deployment-to-heroku/","owner":"Antirez"}]
