Also, if you’re a frequent flyer, you probably also really enjoy drinking and paying as little as possible for it. So here’s a way that you (and sometimes also your entire family) can all have unlimited party nights out — on your airline’s dollar!</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Decide you want to party and not pay anything.</li>\n  <li>Go online and buy a refundable business or first class ticket with your airline to anywhere.</li>\n  <li>Go to the airport.</li>\n  <li>Check in, go past security and enter your airline’s lounge.</li>\n  <li>Party.</li>\n  <li>Use the lounge’s wifi to cancel your ticket (or call the airline to do it for you)</li>\n  <li>Leave.</li>\n  <li>Notice that you still have cash in your pocket!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Yes, it’s abusive, but there you go.</p>\n","link":"https://lg.io/2012/06/16/using-your-airline-status-for-free-party-nights-out.html","owner":"Larry Land"}]
