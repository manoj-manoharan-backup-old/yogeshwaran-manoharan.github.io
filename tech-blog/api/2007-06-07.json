[{"title":"Coming up: Ubuntu Development Server Guide","description":"My articles about setting up a Ubuntu Development Server (part 1 and part 2) have been very successful.\nI&rsquo;m considering writing a new guide with more up-to-date information on how to setup a development server that allows you (and your team) to develop software, manage source code, track tickets and all that stuff.\nWhat should, according to you, be included in this guide? Please let me know! Just leave a comment and I&rsquo;ll pick it up.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/06/07/coming-up-ubuntu-development-server-guide/","owner":"Antirez"}]
