[{"title":"Ariejan.net server move","description":"Just a note to let you know that Ariejan.net has just been moved to a new server! Well, I&rsquo;ve moved from shared hosting with Delta9 Internet to a VPS solution.\nWhy on earth would I do such a thing? I&rsquo;m very happy with the service I&rsquo;ve recieved from Delta9 in the past. However, I wanted more control over my hosting. I&rsquo;m a web developer and I have special needs. Such needs include Subversion and Ruby on Rails hosting, state-of-the art PHP and MySQL installations.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/04/29/ariejannet-server-move/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
