[{"title":"Rails 3 + Devise + Uploadify = No Flash Session Hacks","description":"Uploadify is a great project to provide file uploads in your project. The problem is, it&rsquo;s written in flash.\nBesides the point that it is flash, there&rsquo;s something else that has been bothering me a lot: sessions. ~ The problem is like this. When a browsers opens a connection to your Rails app, it has a session. Normally, session information is stored a cookie that is sent with every request. This session also contains information needed for you to stay logged in as a particular user.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/03/27/rails-3-devise-uploadify-no-flash-session-hacks/","owner":"Antirez"}]
