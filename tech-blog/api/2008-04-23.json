[{"title":"GIT: Using the stash","description":"I bet the following has happened to you: you are happily working on a project and are in the middle of something. You are not ready to commit your changes, because you your tests don&rsquo;t pass yet. Then your client calls with a bug report that needs to be fixed right now.
