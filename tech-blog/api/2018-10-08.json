[{"title":"Build Electron Applications With Vue.js And Webpack","description":"\n                    <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you thought you&rsquo;d try to build a cross-platform desktop application using the very popular <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/\">Electron</a> framework as well as the very popular <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a> JavaScript framework. At first glance it might seem as easy as defining an Electron configuration, but in reality, a little more needs to be done when using Webpack to build the project.</p>\n<p>I had <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/tags/electron/\">written a few tutorials</a> a while back around Electron, and even one with Vue.js, but in that example the Vue CLI and Webpack were not part of the equation.
