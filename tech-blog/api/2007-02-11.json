[{"title":"6.170, CVS, and SVN","description":"I&rsquo;m taking 6.170 Lab in Software Engineering this semester. The course sucks in various ways, but one of the most egregious, in my opinion, is that they force you to use CVS for your version control. Problem sets are distributed by the TAs importing them into your repository, and are then checked out later to be graded. Well, CVS sucks, and there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to use it when there are sane, modern alternatives like SVN and SVK","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2007/02/3/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
