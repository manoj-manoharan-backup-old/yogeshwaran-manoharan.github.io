[{"title":"Streaming Cassandra at WePay - Part 2","description":"<p>In the <a href=\"/posts/streaming-cassandra-at-wepay-part-1\">first half</a> of this blog post series, we explained our decision-making process of designing a streaming data pipeline for Cassandra at WePay. In this post, we will break down the pipeline into three sections and discuss each of them in more detail:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Cassandra to Kafka with CDC agent</li>\n  <li>Kafka with BigQuery with KCBQ</li>\n  <li>Transformation with BigQuery view</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2 id=\"cassandra-to-kafka-with-cdc-agent\">Cassandra to Kafka with CDC Agent</h2>\n\n<p>The Cassandra CDC agent is a JVM process that is intended to be deployed on each node in a Cassandra cluster. The agent is comprised of several interdependent processors, running concurrently and working together to publish change events to Kafka.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"snapshot-processor\">Snapshot Processor</h3>\n\n<p>This processor is responsible for bootstrapping new tables. It looks up the CDC configuration to determine the snapshot mode, an","link":"https://wecode.wepay.com/posts/streaming-cassandra-at-wepay-part-2","owner":"Wemake.services"}]
