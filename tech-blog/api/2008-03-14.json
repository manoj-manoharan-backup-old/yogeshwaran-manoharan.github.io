[{"title":"Conkeror","description":"I&rsquo;ve recently switched to Conkeror as my primary browser. It started life as a Firefox extension, but nowadays it&rsquo;s a standalone app built on top of Mozilla&rsquo;s xulrunner, so it uses the Gecko rendering engine.\nWhat it is, is an emacs implemented in Javascript, for the web. This means on the one hand that it acts like emacs. Most of the basic emacs keybindings are supported &ndash; you open URLs with C-x C-f, and have buffers you can switch between with C-x b and so on.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/03/conkeror/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
