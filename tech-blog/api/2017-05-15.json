[{"title":"Create A Raspberry Pi Cluster With Docker Swarm And Raspbian Linux","description":"\n                    <p>Back when I was first learning about <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a>, I had tried to use it on one of my <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> devices. This was when Docker had first become available officially for Raspbian. When I was playing around with Docker and my Raspberry Pi, I had <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/09/deploying-docker-containers-raspberry-pi-device/\">written a tutorial</a> for deploying containers, or more specifically a Ghost container. This was a single container on a single device or node. Since then I started playing around with Docker Swarm and decided to create a Raspberry Pi cluster.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to take several Raspberry Pi devices, cluster them using Docker Swarm, and deploying containers to Swarm with replica copies.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/create-raspberry-pi-","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/create-raspberry-pi-cluster-docker-swarm-raspbian-linux/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Overlapping Fragments with VideoViews","description":"Recently, in a client project, I ran into an issue with VideoViews overlapping each other, even though they were part of different Fragments. As is the case with most Views, when adding a Fragment on top of another, the top Fragment will have its Views drawn on top of the bottom Fragment. This however, is […]","link":"/dev/2017/05/overlapping-fragments-with-videoviews/","owner":"Pusher"},{"title":"Why changes in Phoenix 1.3 are so important?","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/wemake-services/why-changes-in-phoenix-1-3-are-so-important-2d50c9bdabb9?source=rss----3ac85505f67d---4","owner":"WebEngage"}]
