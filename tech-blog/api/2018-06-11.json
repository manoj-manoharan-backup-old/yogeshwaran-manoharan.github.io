Once it is created, it loses the ability to change the history of commits.","link":"https://kolosek.com/git-tags/","owner":"Kogan.com"},{"title":"Kogame (Koh-Gah-Mi) - A real time game in Django","description":"For our March hackday this year we decided to build a multiplayer game \r\nusing\r\n\r\n[Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We've been \r\nkeeping\r\n\r\nan eye on channels over the time, and thought with the release of channels \r\n2.0 that\r\n\r\nit was the right time to dive in and get some practical experience. The \r\norganisers\r\n\r\ndidn't want to do yet-another-chat-system implementation, so they decided \r\nto make\r\n\r\nthings a bit more interesting, and look at writing a real-time game.","link":"https://devblog.kogan.com/blog/kogame-django-channels","owner":"Kinvolk"}]
