[{"title":"Java repositories testing","description":"\n<p>A few days ago Iâ€™ve stumbled upon SQL query performance issue. Git claims that I was the author so\nmaybe that&rsquo;s the reason I remember this feature. There was like 3 classes, everything was super easy\nand super fast all I needed to do was to let Hibernate do its thing. Then time passed, new features\nwere requested, the model becomes more complex, the number of rows increased to ~4 million and\noriginal query became too slow.</p>\n<p>When working on query optimization I was really happy to find that detailed tests are in place. With\nproper test setup I was able to test my new query to make sure all requirements are met and then\nquickly copy paste query to sqldeveloper run it on a test environment and verify if performance is\nacceptable. It wasn&rsquo;t simple query and it took me some time to figure out how to make it quick and\nwork exactly as old one. That was the time I was really glad that we invested in detailed unit tests\nin the beginning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.pchudz","link":"https://blog.pchudzik.com/201611/java-repository-testing/","owner":"Paul Lewis"}]
