[{"title":"Aggregate SQL Data From Multiple Rows Into A Single Row","description":"\n                    <p>Recently I found myself needing to aggregate my multiple row SQL data into a single row. This was because the parent data was more useful to me than the multiple rowâ€™d data, but I still needed to include it because it was still an essential part of my report. The data looked something like the following:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>firstname</th>\n<th>lastname</th>\n<th>department</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Nic</td>\n<td>Raboy</td>\n<td>Engineering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maria</td>\n<td>Campos</td>\n<td>Emergency Room</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nic</td>\n<td>Raboy</td>\n<td>Operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nic</td>\n<td>Raboy</td>\n<td>Design</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/10/aggregate-sql-data-multiple-rows-single-row/'>Aggregate SQL Data From Multiple Rows Into A Single Row</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/10/aggregate-sql-data-multiple-rows-single-row/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
