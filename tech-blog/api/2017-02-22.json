In that tutorial we made use of NoSQL as the database, Golang as the backend, and Angular as the client frontend. However, I realize that not everyone is a Go developer.</p>\n<p>This time around we’re going to take a look at developing the same full stack movie database application, but using Node.js instead of Golang. It is a good example to show that elements in the stack are modular and each element is replaceable with another technology.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/build-full-stack-movie-database-nosql-node-js-angular/'>Build A Full Stack Movie Database With NoSQL, Node.js, And Angular</a> appeared fi","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/build-full-stack-movie-database-nosql-node-js-angular/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"How to Find Housing in San Francisco","description":"<p>Finding housing in SF isn’t always easy.

On small and slow devices with limited system resources and connected via a damn slow network connection we do have to care differently on how to build and ship our apps. In these circumstances it pays off and it&rsquo;s absolutely essential to optimize our applications and the resulting Docker images for size.</p>\n\n<p>SIZE DOES MATTER</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hypriot.com/images/build-smallest-possible-docker-image/docker-image-minimal.png\" alt=\"docker-image-minimal.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>If we&rsquo;re doing it right we&rsquo;ll get a lot of benefits such as blasting fast download speed for updating to a new or more secured version.
