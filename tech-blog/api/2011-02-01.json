[{"title":"Hot: Firefly 1.3.0 URL Shortener released","description":"I&rsquo;ve been doing some work on Firefly lately and tonight I&rsquo;ve released version 1.3.0. If you&rsquo;re using Firefly it&rsquo;s recommended you upgrade to the latest and greatest version. ~ For those who missed it: Firefly is a simple URL shortener gem that can be used to host your own personal (or corporate) URL shortner on your own domain. Since Firefly is rack-based, it&rsquo;s easy to deploy to Heroku or other ruby hosting providers.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/02/01/hot-firefly-130-url-shortener-released/","owner":"Antirez"}]
