[{"title":"A Tale of Two 3D Printers (and all additive manufacturing processes)","description":"\n\n<p>I have wanted a 3D printer for a very long time. I hope you can tell from my <a href=\"https://queue.acm.org/\">ACM\nQueue</a> column that I like to do a lot of research and\nI tend to want <em>the best</em>\nthing. I had been keeping my eyes on the 3D printer product space for quite some\ntime. This article is going to go over the technical details behind 3D printing\nas well as my experience with two different products. When I finally decided to\nbuy a 3D printer, I wanted to try ones that used different additive\nmanufacturing processes: material extrusion via fused deposition modeling (FDM)\nand vat polymerization via stereolithography (SLA)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. While I would have loved to\nhave gotten a printer for each of the seven different additive manufacturing\nprocesses, I did not. However, I did dig into the details of all the various\nadditive manufacturing processes and technologies. Letâ€™s dive in!</p>\n\n<p>If you would prefer to skip ","link":"https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/a-tale-of-two-3d-printers/","owner":"Jesal Gadhia"}]
