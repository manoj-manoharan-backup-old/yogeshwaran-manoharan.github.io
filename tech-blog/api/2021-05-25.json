In other words, if you already perform user analytics or if you’re poised to scale as a company in the next few years, chaining your user analytics capabilities to your feature flagging system can be seen as paying a premium for short-term convenience instead of investing in long-term functionality and flexibility. Different tools have different strengths, and given the right amount of flexibility, a company can hand-select a range of extremely specialized tools that are best-in-class within their limited scope and integrate them with each other, rather than relying on a single tool that does a few things well and others not so well.","link":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/embrace-dont-replace-integrating-feature-flag-data-existing-analytics-solutions","owner":"CleverTap"},{"title":"Exponential explorer","description":"<p>I wanted to get a better intuition for exponential growth.
