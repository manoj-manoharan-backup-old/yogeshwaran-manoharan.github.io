[{"title":"ReactJS : Server side rendering with router v4 & redux","description":"When I wrote React.js: Server side rendering a few months back, I used react router v3.0.2. But ever since react router released v4, which is a total rewrite into a declarative format, the old blog post won&rsquo;t work with react router v4. So I decided to write a new blog as 2nd part of it which uses react router v4 along with redux.\nSince we already have a blog post explaining the initial setup, I will be skipping the repeated steps needed here but will add the new updates need to use the new router.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2017-06-03-reactjs-server-side-rendering-with-router-v4-and-redux/","owner":"Codemancers"}]
