[{"title":"Bundler: Cleanup old unused gems","description":"Recently I resumed an old project {after 2 months}. My peers are still working on it and they have upgraded lots of gems. After running bundle install, many gems got upgraded and old version were still hanging around in vendor folder. This little handy command helped in removing them:\nbundle clean -V NOTE: Btw, I always install gems in ./vendor/ruby folder, and don&rsquo;t maintain any rvm gemsets for projects.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-03-27-bundle-clean/","owner":"Codemancers"}]
