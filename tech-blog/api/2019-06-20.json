Rewriting a big component of an existing system is always challenging. In particular, we really wanted to avoid regressing on any workloads, including simple transactional queries where the existing planner was already generating the best plan. A cost-based optimizer inherently does more work and thus involves longer planning times. To mitigate this, we worked on caching and reusing optimizer state across multiple instances of the same query.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/query-plan-caching-in-cockroachdb/","owner":"Cloudflare"}]
