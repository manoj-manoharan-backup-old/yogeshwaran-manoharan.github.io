Flatcar Container Linux is a self-updating operating system designed for containers, making it ideal for running Kubernetes and other container platforms. It is suitable for anyone deploying containerized applications, particularly those seeking to do so securely or at scale.\nBecause it&rsquo;s container optimized, Flatcar Container Linux is already being used as the OS of choice for EKS workers by companies around the world.","link":"/blog/2021/02/deploying-an-eks-cluster-with-flatcar-workers/","owner":"Kinvolk"},{"title":"Flatcar Container Linux Pro now available on the AWS Marketplace","description":"Late last year we announced a new family of Flatcar Container Linux offerings, called Flatcar Container Linux Pro, a marketplace-delivered, cloud-optimized version of our well known Flatcar Container Linux solution. It’s ideal for production container environments requiring the highest performance, security and support.\nBeing cloud-optimized means that our Flatcar Container Linux Pro offerings come with additional features, specific to each cloud provider. This allows our customers to make the most out of their cloud instances, while building on a common base OS that can run anywhere.","link":"/blog/2021/02/flatcar-container-linux-pro-now-available-on-the-aws-marketplace/","owner":"Kinvolk"},{"title":"How we sped up Dropbox Android app startup by 30%","description":"","link":"https://dropbox.tech/mobile/how-we-sped-up-dropbox-android-app-startup-by-30-","owner":"Dropbox"},{"title":"Indeed’s FOSS Contributor Fund: 2021 Updates","description":null,"link":"https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2021/02/indeeds-foss-contributor-fund-2021-updates/","owner":"Indeed"},{"title":"Next Stop – Building a Data Pipeline from Edge to Insight","description":null,"link":"https://blog.cloudera.com/next-stop-building-a-data-pipeline-from-edge-to-insight/","owner":"Cloudera"},{"title":"Rethinking the Next-gen Analytics Web App at trivago","description":"After almost a decade, we decided to rebuild our in-house Business Intelligence web application to better support the organization. It is always challenging to replace software with a long history and a high degree of complexity. Nevertheless, we successfully completed the project because we fundamentally challenged and re-thought all aspects of the project.\nThe result at the end of the revamp was extraordinary. We were able to build a reliable product that is user-friendly and capable of data processing at scale.","link":"https://tech.trivago.com/2021/02/09/rethinking-the-next-gen-analytics-web-app-at-trivago/","owner":"Trivago"},{"title":"Unbiased median absolute deviation","description":"<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation\">median absolute deviation</a> (<span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\textrm{MAD}\\)</span>)\nis a robust measure of scale.\nFor distribution <span class=\"math inline\">\\(X\\)</span>, it can be calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[\\textrm{MAD} = C \\cdot \\textrm{median}(|X - \\textrm{median}(X)|)\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math inline\">\\(C\\)</span> is a constant scale factor.\nThis metric can be used as a robust alternative to the standard deviation.\nIf we want to use the <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\textrm{MAD}\\)</span> as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator\">consistent estimator</a>\nfor the standard deviation under the normal distribution,\nwe should set</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[C = C_{\\infty} = \\dfrac{1}{\\Phi^{-1}(3/4)} \\approx 1.4826022185056.\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\Phi^{-1}\\)</span> is the quantile function of the standard normal di","link":"https://aakinshin.net/posts/unbiased-mad/","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"}]
