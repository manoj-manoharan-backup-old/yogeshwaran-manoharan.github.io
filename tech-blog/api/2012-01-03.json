[{"title":"Music Hack Day London 2011","description":"Last month we attended Music Hack Day London 2011. A special one, Music Hack Day was born in London 3 years ago and we were happy to attend a hack day again in it’s homeland. Picture For those who do not know of Music Hack Day, it’s a great weekend-long event aimed at music and sound hackers. Anyone can attend the event for free, and their goal is to conceptualize and develop innovative hacks of either software or hardware.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/music-hack-day-london-2011","owner":"Soshace"}]
