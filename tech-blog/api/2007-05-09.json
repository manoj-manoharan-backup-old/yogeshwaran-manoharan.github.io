[{"title":"Rails Snippet: Write like Orwell with to_sentence","description":"A few weeks ago I posted an article that explained how to create a comma separated list from a hash of objects. When I was browsing the Rails API documentation I came across a method named to_sentence.\nWhat this little bugger does is create a human readable, comma separated list of items in an array or hash. But the big difference here is that you can specify what the last separator must be.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/05/09/rails-snippet-write-like-orwell-with-to_sentence/","owner":"Antirez"}]
