[{"title":"Reducing Type Hierarchies","description":"Introduction I see a lot of developers coming to Go from object oriented programing languages such as C# and Java. Because these developers have been trained to use type hierarchies, it makes sense for them to use this same pattern in Go. However, there are aspects of Go that don’t allow type hierarchies to provide the same level of functionality they do in other object oriented programming languages. Specifically, the concepts of base types and subtyping don’t exist in Go so type reuse requires a different way of thinking.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2016/10/reducing-type-hierarchies.html","owner":"William Kennedy"},{"title":"Repair: Marantz PM80 Mk2","description":"The venerable Marantz PM80 Mk2.
