This application was made with the first version of Ionic Framework and at the time was great because it accomplished more than the Google Authenticator application. Now that Ionic 2 is approaching stable release, it seemed like a cool idea to take this one-time password application and build it with the latest and greatest including Angular.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re going to see how to create an iOS and Android time-based one-time password manager using Ionic 2, Angular, and TypeScript.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/build-time-based-one-time-password-manager-ionic-2/'>Build A Time-Based One-Time Password Manager With Ionic 2</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/build-time-based-one-time-password-manager-ionic-2/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Microservices and the monolith","description":"In a previous series of blog posts, we covered our decision to move away from a monolithic architecture, replacing it with microservices, interacting synchronously with each other over HTTP, and asynchronously using events. In this post, we review our progress toward this goal, and talk about the conditions and strategy required to decommission our monolith.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/microservices-and-the-monolith","owner":"Soshace"}]
