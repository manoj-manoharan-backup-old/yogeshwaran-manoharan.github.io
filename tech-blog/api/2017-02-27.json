Well, I recently had a moment where I felt like a total newbie. I go through a lot of installations of Raspbian Linux and during every installation I go through a network configuration process. This process of configuration is either by Ethernet or UART connection. Well, it turns out there is an easier way.</p>\n<p>It is actually possible to apply a network configuration through the FAT mountable partition saving the hassle of having to connect over UART or Ethernet first. We’re going to see how this is possible.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/automatical","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/automatically-apply-wifi-network-configuration-raspberry-pi/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Running Tensorflow on AWS GPUs","description":"I&rsquo;ve been spending some time learning deep learning and tensorflow recently, and as part of that project I wanted to be able to train models using GPUs on EC2. This post contains some notes on what it took to get that working. As many people have commented, the environment setup is often the hardest part of getting a deep learning setup going, so hopefully this will be useful reference to someone.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/post/tensorflow-on-aws/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
