[{"title":"New Blog Location","description":"I finally got fed up with Blogger, and am moving this blog to live on Wordpress hosted off of scripts.mit.edu. In the process of converting everything over and setting up Wordpress I&rsquo;ve decided I hate it, but hopefully I hate it less than I hate Blogger. We&rsquo;ll see.\nI&rsquo;ve also changed the URL to this blog from http://nelhage.com/blog to http://blog.nelhage.com, which I like better as URL anyways. It should redirect to the toplevel of the new URL now.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/09/new-blog/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
