For a while now I’ve wanted to mess around with charts in my mobile applications, but it kept getting pushed to my development back-burner.</p>\n<p>I decided to push myself to give it a shot. Using <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a> to build mobile Android and iOS applications, you’re left with a few possibilities for adding charts because so many JavaScript libraries exist. In particular, we’re going to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.chartjs.org/\">Chart.js</a> and the <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a> wrapper, <a href=\"http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/\">Angular Chart</a>.
