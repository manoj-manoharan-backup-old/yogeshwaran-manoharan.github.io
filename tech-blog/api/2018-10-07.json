[{"title":"\nWriting system software: code comments.\n","description":"For quite some time Iâ€™ve wanted to record a new video talking about code comments for my \"writing system software\" series on YouTube. However, after giving it some thought, I realized that the topic was better suited for a blog post, so here we are. In this post I analyze Redis comments, trying to categorize them.  Along the way I try to show why, in my opinion, writing comments is of paramount importance in order to produce good code, that is maintainable in the long run and understandable by others and by the authors during modifications and debugging activities.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/124\n","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"},{"title":"bpftrace (DTrace 2.0) for Linux 2018","description":"The private bpftrace repository has just been made public, which is big news for DTrace fans. Created by Alastair Robertson, bpftrace is an open source high-level tracing front-end that lets you analyze systems in custom ways. It's shaping up to be a DTrace version 2.0: more capable, and built from the ground up for the modern era of the eBPF virtual machine. eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is in the Linux kernel and is the new hotness in systems engineering. It is being developed for BSD, too, where BPF originated.\n","link":"http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2018-10-08/dtrace-for-linux-2018.html","owner":"Brendan Eich"}]
