Not too long ago I wrote about an open source object storage software called <a href=\"https://www.minio.io/\">Minio</a> and how I was <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/using-raspberry-pi-distributed-object-storage-minio/\">using it on my Raspberry Pi</a> for backups. The great thing about Minio is it shares the same APIs as AWS S3, but can be deployed to your own hardware, eliminating Amazon as a dependency.</p>\n<p>This time around I thought it would be great to share how to use Minio as an object storage for a Node.js application that uses the middleware, Multer, for handling file uploads.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/upload","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/upload-files-minio-object-storage-cloud-node-js-multer/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
