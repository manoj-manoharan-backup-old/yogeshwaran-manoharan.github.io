[{"title":"Load Balancing A Docker Swarm Cluster With An NGINX Reverse Proxy","description":"\n                    <p>If you’ve been working towards containerizing your web applications like I have, you might be at a point where you’re ready to start clustering your containers. Previously I had written about <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/04/create-cluster-microservice-containers-docker-swarm/\">creating a container cluster with Docker Swarm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/nginx-reverse-proxy-containerized-docker-applications/\">using NGINX as a reverse proxy for a few containers</a>. The catch here is that neither of these previous tutorials were meant to work together. In the previous example we were using a reverse proxy for containers on a single server. While Docker Swarm offers it’s own load balancing, you’ll find it makes sense to have NGINX as well because not every container can run on the host as port 80.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to create two service containers that are replicated across several nodes.
