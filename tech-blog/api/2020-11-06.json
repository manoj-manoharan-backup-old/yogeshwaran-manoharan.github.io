[{"title":"Leveraging Golang for Game Development and Operations","description":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/articles/116/golangheader.png\" width=\"1999\" height=\"758\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Hi, my name is Aaron Torres and I’m an engineering manager for the Riot Developer Experience team. We accelerate how game teams across Riot develop, deploy, and operate their backend microservices at scale - globally. I’ve been at the company for a little over 3 years and I’ve been writing Go code that entire time. In this article, we’ll be specifically looking at how a few different teams use Go. I’ll be tagging in two technologists - Chad Wyszynski from RDX Operability and Justin O’Brien from <em>VALORANT - </em>to discuss how they use Go for their projects.</p>\n","link":"https://technology.riotgames.com/news/leveraging-golang-game-development-and-operations","owner":"Rightscale"}]
