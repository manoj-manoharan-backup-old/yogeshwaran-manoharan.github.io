[{"title":"Open Source is a privilege. Not a right.","description":"Edit: this is not a Gitlab specific issue. I&rsquo;ve seen it before and I&rsquo;m seeing it again at the Gitlab project.\nThe past few months I&rsquo;ve been contributing to the Gitlab project. This has been a great experience, mostly because Gitlab has become a very popular project with over 2.3k watchers right now.\nIt gives me great satisfaction knowing that my code is being used by hundreds if not thousands of people right now.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/03/20/open-source-is-a-privilege-not-a-right/","owner":"Antirez"}]
