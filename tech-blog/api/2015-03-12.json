[{"title":"DIY Ruby CPU profiling - Part II","description":"In Part I we learned what CPU profiling means and also about the two modes of CPU profiling. In this part we&rsquo;re going to explore CPU time and Wall time, the units used to measure execution cost. We&rsquo;ll also write some code to get these measurements as the first step towards building our CPU profiler.\nPart II. CPU time and Wall time Wall time Wall time is just the regular real world time that elapses between a method call and return.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2015-03-12-diy-ruby-cpu-profiling-part-ii/","owner":"Codelitt"},{"title":"Make A Gallery-Like Image Grid Using Ionic Framework","description":"\n                    <p>I recently started making an application with <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a> that made heavy use of images both remotely and locally. During this time, my goal was to present the images in a grid that looks good for all device sizes and orientations.</p>\n<p>One might think this would be an easy task because Ionic offers both grids and a responsive class, however, trivial was far from the case. Instead I had to go to my programming roots and create some display logic when looping through my arrays of images. The following guide will show exactly what I had to do.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/03/make-a-gallery-like-image-grid-using-ionic-framework/'>Make A Gallery-Like Image Grid Using Ionic Framework</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/03/make-a-gallery-like-image-grid-using-ionic-framework/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
