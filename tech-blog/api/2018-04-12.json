[{"title":"How to Leverage Geo-partitioning","description":"Introduction As we&#x2019;ve written about previously, geographically distributed databases like CockroachDB offer a number of benefits including reliability, security, and cost-effective deployments. We believe you shouldn&#x2019;t have to sacrifice these upsides to realize impressive throughput and low latencies. That&#x2019;s why we created geo-partitioning.\nThis blog post defines two new features, geo-partitioning and archival-partitioning, as well as explains when you might want to leverage these features.
