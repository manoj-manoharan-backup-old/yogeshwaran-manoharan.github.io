[{"title":"Trac, WebAdmin plugin and global configuration","description":"<p>As you may know I manage quite a few <a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/\">trac</a> installations. A few days ago I upgrade my server from Ubuntu &ldquo;Dapper Drake&rdquo; 6.06 to Ubuntu &ldquo;Feisty Fawn&rdquo; 7.04. This also upgrade trac 0.9.x to 0.10.3.</p>\n<p>I was happy, since trac 0.10.3 has many improvements over 0.9.x, but there was one thing I was not so happy about. After the upgrade, I upgraded all my trac installations and everything seemed to be okay, except for the <a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WebAdmin\">WebAdmin plugin</a>. Apparently it was not installed anymore.</p>\n<p>What happened? After upgrading the trac package, the plugins directory was emptied. Well, just re-install the WebAdmin plugin for 0.10.x.</p>","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/05/30/trac-webadmin-plugin-and-global-configuration/","owner":"Antirez"}]
