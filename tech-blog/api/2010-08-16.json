[{"title":"Navigating the Linux Kernel","description":"In response to my query last time, ezyang asked for any tips or tricks I have for finding my way around the Linux kernel. I&rsquo;m not sure I have much in the way of systematic advice for tracking down the answers to questions about the Linux kernel, but thinking about what I do when posed with a patch to Linux that I need understand, or question I need to answer, I&rsquo;ve come up with a collection of tips that will hopefully be helpful to others looking to source-dive Linux for whatever reason.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/08/navigating-the-linux-kernel/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
