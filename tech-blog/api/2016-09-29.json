[{"title":"Implementing Column Families in CockroachDB","description":"CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a transactional key value store. We don&#x2019;t (yet) expose the kv layer but it&#x2019;s general purpose enough that we&#x2019;ve used it to implement SQL without any special trickery.\nThe particulars of how we represent data in a SQL table as well as the table metadata are internally called the &#x201C;format version&#x201D;. Our first format version was deliberately simple, causing some performance inefficiencies.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/sql-cockroachdb-column-families/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
