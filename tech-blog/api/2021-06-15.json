These are languages that launched in the 1990s (except for Node.js) and were adopted widely despite not having a large vendor behind them. The development, maintenance, and promotion of Java and .NET are backed by Oracle and Microsoft. A lot of people are paid a lot of money to keep these platforms up to date and relevant. PHP, ruby, python and Node.js don’t have this direct company backing. PHP is run by a small cabal of folks who vote on features […]","link":"https://alanstorm.com/aging-of-the-independent-c-derived-open-source-programming-languages/","owner":"Alan Storm"},{"title":"Answering the Top 10 Questions About Kotlin’s Future","description":"In this post you’ll find the answers to 10 of the most upvoted questions about Kotlin’s future.

However, navigating the cloud-native ecosystem is complex and rapidly changing, making it difficult to build a robust production platform required to run mission critical business services.&nbsp;&nbsp;To add to the complexity, the collection of required open-source projects needs to be integrated, automated, and tested for resiliency, scale, and interoperability which is expensive to build and maintain. Unfortunately, many organizations don’t have the right skills and expert resources to get there themselves, leaving them with gaps in their capabilities or delaying production deployment. They need a partner who can help guide them, train them, and design and build a production-ready infrastructure that they can manage and feel confident in using.&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineered from","link":"https://d2iq.com/blog/how-d2iq-fits-into-the-broader-cncf-kubernetes-ecosystem","owner":"Mesosphere"},{"title":"How to Better Manage Apache Kafka by Exporting Kafka Messages via Control Center","description":"This blog post is the second in a four-part series that discusses a few new Confluent Control Center features that are introduced with Confluent Platform 6.2.0.
