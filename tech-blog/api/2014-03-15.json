[{"title":"Exported/Unexported Identifiers In Go","description":"Introduction\nOne of the first things I learned about in Go was using an uppercase or lowercase letter as the first letter when naming a type, variable or function. It was explained that when the first letter was capitalized, the identifier was public to any piece of code that wanted to use it. When the first letter was lowercase, the identifier was private and could only be accessed within the package it was declared.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/03/exportedunexported-identifiers-in-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
