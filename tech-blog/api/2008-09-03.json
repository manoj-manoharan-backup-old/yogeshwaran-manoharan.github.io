[{"title":"JRuby with Thomas Enebo","description":"This morning I attended another JRuby talk, this time with Thomas Enebo. It turned out to be, almost default, Sun JRuby talk.\nThere was one interesting difference, though. Normally we are shown how to run Ruby on Java and how to use Java components in our Ruby apps. Thomas took JMonkeyEngine (a java 3d scenegraph/game engine) and showed that he coded a simple game in Ruby, steering clear of the rather complex Java code.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/09/03/jruby-with-thomas-enebo/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Panel Discussion with DHH and Rails Core Members","description":"Yesterday evening we attended a panel discussion with DHH and Rails Core Members Jeremy Kemper and Michael Koziarski.\nDHH elaborated on default choices (like database, templating system and test suite) after being asked if Rails would switch over to RSpec instead of TestUnit. The answer was that Rails offers several defaults, which should suffice for new and basic users, who don&rsquo;t know about all options and just want to get started.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/09/03/panel-discussion-with-dhh-and-rails-core-members/","owner":"Antirez"}]
