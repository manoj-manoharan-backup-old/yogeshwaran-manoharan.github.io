I was wondering why and then I found the code for maps and it all made sense.\nhttps://golang.org/src/runtime/hashmap.go\nAt least for me, this code is complicated.

This should explain why they are unordered, efficient and fast.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/12/macro-view-of-map-internals-in-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
