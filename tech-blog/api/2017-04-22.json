[{"title":"APFS filesystem format","description":"I started to reverse engineer APFS and want to share what I found out so far. You can send me feedback and ideas on this post via Twitter.\nNotice: I created a test image with macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32). All results are guesses and the reverse engineering is work in progress. Also newer versions of APFS might change structures. The information below is neither complete nor proven to be correct.","link":"https://blog.cugu.eu/post/apfs/","owner":"Jon Skeet"}]
