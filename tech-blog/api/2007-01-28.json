[{"title":"Ruby: Sort an array of objects by an attribute","description":"In this example I&rsquo;ll show you how easy it is to sort an array of (the same kind of) objects by an attribute. Let&rsquo;s say you have an array of User objects that have the attributes &lsquo;name&rsquo; and &lsquo;login_count&rsquo;. First, find all users.\n@users = User.find(:all) Now, we have to sort this array by &lsquo;name&rsquo;. Since we don&rsquo;t know if any user used capitals in his name or not, we use &lsquo;downcase&rsquo; to sort without case sensitivity.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/01/28/ruby-sort-an-array-of-objects-by-an-attribute/","owner":"Antirez"}]
