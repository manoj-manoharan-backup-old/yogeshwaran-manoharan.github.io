[{"title":"Parallelize Shell or Bash Scripts Using Xargs","description":"Who doesn&#39;t want to go faster? It is common to have a setup script that downloads various packages or tools. Here&#39;s an example:\n#!/bin/sh -ex # hugo https://gohugo.io go get github.com/gohugoio/hugo # https://github.com/client9/misspell ./godownloader-misspell 0.3.4 # shellcheck.net docker pull koalaman/shellcheck It runs one line after another in serial. That&#39;s slow.\nBut notice how each line doesn&#39;t depend on any other (and comment and blank lines don&#39;t matter). If you can write a script in such a way, then you really speed things up by running in parallel using xargs:","link":"https://www.client9.com/parallelize-shell-or-bash-scripts-using-xargs/","owner":"Nick Desaulniers"}]
