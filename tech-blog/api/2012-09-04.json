[{"title":"Git: Interactive Revert","description":"I recently made a commit in a project that, mistakenly, included changes to db/schema.rb. My local schema was out of date and this could cause trouble for the others in my team.\nLuckily we use a successful git branching model so my changes were still up for review by the team.\nThe change I made was part of larger commit. But all I wanted was to revert serveral chunks from db/schema.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/09/04/git-interactive-revert/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
