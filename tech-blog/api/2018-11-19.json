[{"title":"Create A Self-Signed Certificate For Node.js On MacOS","description":"\n                    <p>I recently picked up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FjC7kP\">Yubico U2F hardware key</a> and thought I&rsquo;d try to create a web application that was protected with two-factor hardware-based authentication. Things were going smooth until I realized that it is mandatory to be using HTTPS within your application, even when testing locally. HTTPS is common, but I&rsquo;d never actually set it up with Node.js because I had always been using services like Cloudflare that configure it for you. The problem is that these services are for live domain names, not necessarily localhost.</p>\n<p>While we&rsquo;re not going to explore U2F hardware keys in this tutorial, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at creating and installing a self-signed certificate for use in Node.js within macOS.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/create-self-signed-certificate-nodejs-macos/'>Create A Self-Signe","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/create-self-signed-certificate-nodejs-macos/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
