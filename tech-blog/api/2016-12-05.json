The talk covers topics around developing your own design philosophy with a focus on decoupling from change. These are things I cover extensively in the Ultimate Go Classes.\nHere is the material that is covered in the talk. Review the Grouping and Decoupling topics.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2016/12/developing-a-design-philosophy-in-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
