[{"title":"Record/Replay testing in Sorbet","description":"In 2017 and 2018, I (along with Paul Tarjan and Dmitry Petrashko) was a founding member of the Sorbet project at Stripe to build a gradual static typechecking system for Ruby, with the aim of enhancing productivity on Stripe’s millions of lines of Ruby, and eventually producing a useful open-source tool. I’m very proud of the work we did (and that others continue to do!) on Sorbet; I think we were very successful, and it was one of the best teams I’ve worked on in a number of ways.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/post/record-replay-in-sorbet/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
