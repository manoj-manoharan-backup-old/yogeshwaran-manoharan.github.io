If you&rsquo;ve been keeping up with the blog recently, I&rsquo;ve published quite a bit of content around <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> as I personally believe it to be the future for API development. Being able to access related and unrelated data on demand through a single endpoint is huge for the people consuming your data and huge for the developers creating the data because of specific model definitions.</p>\n<p>In this episode titled, <strong>GraphQL for API Development</strong>, I&rsquo;m joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leeb\">Lee Byron</a>, one of the co-creators of GraphQL at when he worked at Facebook. Lee gives us all the details on how GraphQL came to be, why it is huge for development, and how to use it successfully in your next application.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' hre","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/08/tpdp-e20-graphql-api-development/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
