EMR’s incredible flexibility makes it a great fit for our analytics jobs.</p>\n\n<p>An extremely important best practice for any analytics project is to ensure your local dev and test environments match your production environment as much as possible.  This eliminates the nasty surprise of launching a job that takes hours only to discover that it fails late into the run due to some unmet dependency or config mistake.  Failing to invest time in the dev/test phase is a surefire way to blow big $$.</p>\n\n<p>Lately I’ve been investigating some configuration settings you can make to your local Hadoop to bring it inline with what you’ll find when you run a job on an EMR cluster.  This is especially important to us since we use S3 as a sort of centralized filesystem and EMR is designed to work wonderfully with S3.
