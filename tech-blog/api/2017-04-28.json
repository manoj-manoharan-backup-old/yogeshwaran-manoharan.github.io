I also made a leap and bought the camera module with it because the new official case by Raspberry Pi has a camera attachment. Probably the most popular development technology for Raspberry Pi is Python, but I am not a fan at all. Instead, I’ve been doing a lot of Go development and figured that would be my best bet when it comes to developing a camera application for the Raspberry Pi. The problem with this is that if I were to compile a Go application on the Raspberry Pi Zero itself, it would probably take ten years (I joke).</p>\n<p>Cross compiling is a thing and we’re going to see how to do this via a different operating system and architecture, yet have it be compatible on the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglot","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/04/cross-compiling-golang-applications-raspberry-pi/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Functional Swift Conference 2017 — Brooklyn","description":"","link":"https://kickstarter.engineering/functional-swift-conference-2017-brooklyn-69341a22645c?source=rss----c5ef8826f270---4","owner":"Khan Academy"},{"title":"How do we maintain 500px?","description":"","link":"https://developers.500px.com/how-do-we-maintain-500px-1012a6fcfabd?source=rss----5d9282daaaa1---4","owner":"Engineering Blogs"}]
