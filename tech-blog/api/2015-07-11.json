[{"title":"Modify The Badge Number Of An Ionic Framework App","description":"\n                    <p>Previously I did a post on Simon Reimler’s blog regarding <a href=\"http://devdactic.com/local-notifications-ionic/\">local notifications with Ionic Framework</a>. However, there is a different kind of notification you can use in your application. In iOS and many different flavors of Android (not all), you have the opportunity to use badge indicators on your launcher icon. Although this doesn’t notify users with a prompt, it will still notify them on their home screen that something needs their attention.</p>\n<p>There is a nifty Apache Cordova plugin created by Sebastián Katzer called <a href=\"https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-badge\">cordova-plugin-badge</a> that will allow us to easily add this functionality to our <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a> mobile applications.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/07/modify-the-badge-number-of-an-io","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/07/modify-the-badge-number-of-an-ionic-framework-app/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
