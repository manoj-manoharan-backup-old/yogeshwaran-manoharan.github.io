[{"title":"Running Go Programs In IronWorker","description":"Introduction\nIron.io has a product called IronWorker which provides a task oriented Linux container that you can run your programs inside. If you are not sure what I mean, think of this as having a temporary Linux virtual machine instantly available for your personal but short term use. IronWorker allows you to load your binaries, code files, support files, shells scripts and just about anything else you may need to run your program in the container.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/09/running-go-programs-in-ironworker.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
