[{"title":"Lessons Learned from 2+ Years of Nightly Jepsen Tests","description":"Since the pre-1.0 betas of CockroachDB, we&apos;ve been using Jepsen to test the correctness of the database in the presence of failures. We have re-run these tests every night as a part of our nightly test suite. Last fall, these tests found their first post-release bug.
