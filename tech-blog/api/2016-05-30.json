[{"title":"Using Couchbase NoSQL In A NativeScript Angular Mobile App","description":"\n                    <p>Not too long ago I created a Couchbase NoSQL plugin with Mehfuz Hossain from Telerik for the <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> framework. Since developing the plugin it has received a lot of positive feedback and great developer adoption. Shortly after its release I published a blog post on <a href=\"https://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/couchbase-mobile-in-a-cross-platform-telerik-nativescript-app\">how to use the Couchbase plugin in a NativeScript app</a>. The blog post I had written focused on using NativeScript’s proprietary vanilla framework. Since then, Angular has been released for NativeScript, so it makes sense to make an Angular version of the tutorial.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to create a cross platform NativeScript application that syncs, using <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> and Couchbase.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/05/using-couchbase-nosql-nativescript-angular-2-mobile-app/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
