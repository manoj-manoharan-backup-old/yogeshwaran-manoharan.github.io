[{"title":"The Nature Of Channels In Go","description":"Introduction\nIn my last post called Concurrency, Goroutines and GOMAXPROCS, I set the stage for talking about channels. We discussed what concurrency was and how goroutines played a role. With that foundation in hand, we can now understand the nature of channels and how they can be used to synchronize goroutines to share resources in a safe, less error prone and fun way.
