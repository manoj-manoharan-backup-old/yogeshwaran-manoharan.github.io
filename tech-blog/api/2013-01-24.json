This way as you add or remove memcached servers, it will minimize the impact of key redistribution. Most clients will provide some sort of consistent hashing, so no need to write your own.</p>\n<p>As you already know, memcached is pretty light on features. One capability we really wanted was the ability to serve up expired data in some cases. For example, we need to fetch the latest leaderboard to display on a page.
