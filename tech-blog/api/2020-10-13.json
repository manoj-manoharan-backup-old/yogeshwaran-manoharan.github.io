[{"title":"Faster Bulk-Data Loading in CockroachDB","description":"Last year the BulkIO team at Cockroach Labs replaced the implementation of our IMPORT bulk-loading feature with a simpler and faster data ingestion pipeline. In most of our tests, it looked like a major improvement: the release notes for CockroachDB v19.2 touted &quot;4x faster&quot; IMPORT. Many a &#x1F389; reaction was clicked, and the team moved on to new projects. But over the following months, it became clear we had celebrated too soon: we started to get reports of some IMPORTs that, instead of being faster, were much slower or even getting stuck.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/bulk-data-import/","owner":"Cloudflare"},{"title":"How Riot Games Uses Slack","description":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/articles/115/slackriotheader2.png\" width=\"1640\" height=\"624\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>I’m Byron Dover, engineering manager for information technology at Riot, and I lead the team responsible for developing enterprise software at Riot - or as we sometimes call it, Riot’s Operating System.
