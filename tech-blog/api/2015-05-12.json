In this case we are going to check various aspects of a string and see if it meets our requirements, being a strong or medium strength password.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/05/use-regex-to-test-password-strength-in-javascript/'>Use RegEx To Test Password Strength In JavaScript</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/05/use-regex-to-test-password-strength-in-javascript/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
