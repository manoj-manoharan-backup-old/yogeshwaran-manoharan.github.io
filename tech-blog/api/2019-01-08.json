Part 1 goes over how we \r\nspent the day and what the goals and motivations are.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor part 2, we're going to delve into the architecture required for running \r\na Django application on Kubernetes, as well as some of the tooling we used \r\nto assist us.\r\nThis post will assume some knowledge with deploying and operating a \r\nproduction web application. I'm not going to spend much time going over the \r\nterminology that Kubernetes uses either. What I hope to do in this post is \r\npresent enough information to kickstart your own migration. Kubernetes is \r\nbig - and knowing what to research now and what to put off until later is \r\nreally tricky.\r\nI'm also going to describe this deployment in terms of Amazon EKS simply \r\nbecause I was on the EKS team, and most of our applications are already on \r\nAWS.","link":"https://devblog.kogan.com/blog/django-on-kubernetes","owner":"Kinvolk"}]
