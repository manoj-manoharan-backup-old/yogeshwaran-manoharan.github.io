Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of the same research. There is so much in the news and on social media around this subject, it would be a good idea to educate yourself.</p>\n<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there are a lot of people trying to mine it rather than buy it. Depending on the type of currency, it could be near impossible to mine or very easy. Take Bitcoin for example. Bitcoin is one of the most difficult coins to mine, while others such as DigiByte are much easier. That&rsquo;s not to say the easier coins won&rsquo;t become more difficult in the future.</p>\n<p>So how do you get started with mining?</p>\n<p>I use a Mac. If you&rsquo;re a Mac owner and you try to find a mining tool online, you&rsquo;re going to struggle because most are for Windows or Linux.
