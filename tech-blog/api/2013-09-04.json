[{"title":"Timer Routines And Graceful Shutdowns In Go","description":"In my Outcast data server I have several data retrieval jobs that run using different go routines. Each routine wakes up on a set interval. The most complex job is the downloading of radar images. What makes this complex is that there are 155 radar stations throughout the United States that take a new picture every 120 seconds. All these radar images can be put together to create a mosaic. When the go routine wakes up to pull down the new images, it must do this as quickly as possible for all 155 stations.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/09/timer-routines-and-graceful-shutdowns.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
