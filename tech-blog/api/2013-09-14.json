[{"title":"Pool Go Routines To Process Task Oriented Work","description":"After working in Go for some time now, I learned how to use an unbuffered channel to build a pool of goroutines. I like this implementation better than what is implemented in this post. &nbsp;That being said, this post still has value in what it describes.\nhttps://github.com/goinggo/work\nOn more than one occasion I have been asked why I use the Work Pool pattern. Why not just start as many Go routines as needed at any given time to get the work done?","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/09/pool-go-routines-to-process-task.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
