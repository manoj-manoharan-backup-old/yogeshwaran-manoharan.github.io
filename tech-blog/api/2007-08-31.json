[{"title":"Blueprint 0.5 Rails Plugin released","description":"A few days ago BlueprintCSS 0.5 was released (read the Olav&rsquo;s posts here). I&rsquo;ve updated the plugin accordingly. The most important change is the use of 24 (!) instead of 14 columns.\nInstallation and usage of the plugin have not changed. See my original announcement for more information.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/31/blueprint-05-rails-plugin-released/","owner":"Antirez"}]
