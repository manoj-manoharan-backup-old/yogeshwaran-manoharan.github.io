[{"title":"Build A Password Manager For iOS And Android Using NativeScript","description":"\n                    <p>There are many password managers on the market right now for Android and iOS. I personally use a mobile application called <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>, but what if you’re the type of person who doesn’t trust these companies with your sensitive passwords?  The solution to this would be to build your own password management application, one where you know the algorithms and the logic. I mean, what if the available password managers are using DES encryption when they should be using AES?  Best thing to do would be to do the job yourself.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to develop a password manager for iOS and Android using the <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> framework by Progress Software. The application that we build will be completely functional, have a polished UI, and use all the best practices for cipher text and mobile development.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/06/build-a-password-manager-for-ios-and-android-using-nativescript/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
