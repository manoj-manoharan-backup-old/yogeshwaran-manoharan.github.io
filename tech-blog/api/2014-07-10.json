[{"title":"What's in a name?","description":"<blockquote>\n  <p>In the once upon a time days of the First Age of Magic, the prudent sorcerer\nregarded his own true name as his most valued possession but also the greatest\nthreat to his continued good health, for—the stories go—once an enemy, even a\nweak unskilled enemy, learned the sorcerer’s true name, then routine and\nwidely known spells could destroy or enslave even the most powerful. As times\npassed, and we graduated to the Age of Reason and thence to the first and\nsecond industrial revolutions, such notions were discredited. Now it seems\nthat the Wheel has turned full circle (even if there never really was a First\nAge) and we are back to worrying about true names again.</p>\n\n  <p>– <em>True Names</em>, V. Vinge</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","link":"https://blog.janestreet.com/whats-in-a-name/","owner":"InVision"}]
