[{"title":"Manage Dependencies With GODEP","description":"Introduction If you are using 3rd party packages, (packages that you don&rsquo;t own or control), you will want a way to create a reproducible build every time you build your projects. If you use 3rd party packages directly and the package authors change things, your projects could break. Even if things don&rsquo;t break, code changes could create inconsistent behavior and bugs.\nKeith Rarick&rsquo;s tool godep&nbsp;is a great step in the right direction for managing 3rd party dependencies and creating reproducible builds.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/10/manage-dependencies-with-godep.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
