[{"title":"Ice Cream Makers and Data Races Part II","description":"Introduction\nDave Cheney published a post called Ice Cream Makers and Data Races. The post showed an example of an interesting data race that can occur when using an interface typed variable to make a method call. If you have not read the post yet please do.
