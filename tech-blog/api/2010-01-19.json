[{"title":"Sign the petition: Stop EU Software Patents","description":"<p>From <a href=\"http://stopsoftwarepatents.eu\">stopsoftwarepatents.eu</a>:</p>\n<p>Our petition aims to unify the voices of concerned Europeans, associations and companies, and calls on our politicians in Europe to stop patents on software with legislative clarifications.</p>\n<p>The patent system is misused to restrain competition for the economical benefit of a few but fails to promote innovation. A software market environment is better off with no patents on software at all. Healthy competition forces market players to innovate.</p>\n<p>European court decisions still accept in many cases the validity of the software patents granted by national patent offices and the European Patent Office (EPO) that is beyond democratic control. They not only continue to grant them, but also to lobby in favor of them. Despite the current deep crisis of the patent system, they are unable to reform and put at risk too many European businesses with their soft granting policy.</p>\n<p>On 2005 the Commissio","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/01/19/sign-the-petition-stop-eu-software-patents/","owner":"Antirez"}]
