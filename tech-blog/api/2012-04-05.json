[{"title":"Wave Raid powered by Timed Comments","description":"One of the SoundCloud APIâ€™s most powerful features is the timed comment. At its core it seems simple enough: a piece of text associated with a point in time for a particular track. But where you see timed opinions, I see a light-weight game scripting engine. So when Johannes Wagener told me he was adding an  event to our JS SDK, I immediately began work on Wave Raid: Quest for the Timed Comment.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/wave-raid","owner":"Soshace"}]
