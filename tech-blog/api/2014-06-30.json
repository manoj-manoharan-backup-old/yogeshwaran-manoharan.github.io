[{"title":"Using Google Analytics With Ionic Framework","description":"\n                    <p>Apple and Google donâ€™t offer much in terms of analytics after an app has been downloaded. Google will take it a step further than Apple and show how many devices have the app installed rather than just downloads, but nothing in terms of usage. To use Google Analytics with <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a>, not much is required.</p>\n<p>There is a convenient plugin created for <a href=\"http://cordova.apache.org/\">Apache Cordova</a> by Dan Wilson called simply <a href=\"https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin\">Google Analytics Plugin</a>.
