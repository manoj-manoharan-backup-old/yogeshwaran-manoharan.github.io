[{"title":"Create A Podcast XML Feed For Publishing To iTunes","description":"\n                    <p>Recently I started a <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/01/the-polyglot-developer-podcast/\">developer podcast</a>, but more work went into it beyond just recording it. I had to create an XML feed file to be published to iTunes as well as Pocket Casts.</p>\n<p>I figured it would be nice to share what goes into creating an XML feed, how to validate it, and how to submit it to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html\">iTunes</a> as well as the popular <a href=\"http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts\">Pocket Casts</a>.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/02/create-podcast-xml-feed-publishing-itunes/'>Create A Podcast XML Feed For Publishing To iTunes</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/02/create-podcast-xml-feed-publishing-itunes/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Self Adjusting DOM and Diffable Data","description":"<p>In my last <a href=\"/self-adjusting-dom/\">post</a>, I gave some simple examples showing how\nyou could use\n<a href=\"http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation\">self adjusting computations</a>,\nor SAC, as embodied by our <a href=\"/introducing-incremental/\">Incremental</a> library, to\nincrementalize the computation of virtual dom nodes. In this post, Iâ€™d like to\ndiscuss how we can extend this approach to more realistic scales, and some of\nthe extensions to Incremental itself that are required to get there.</p>\n\n","link":"https://blog.janestreet.com/self-adjusting-dom-and-diffable-data/","owner":"InVision"}]
