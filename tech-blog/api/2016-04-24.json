[{"title":"Music Streaming Setup","description":"I love music.\nRecently I got into vinyl and I love it. Although it&rsquo;s not digital 24/96 studio quality, there is something relaxing about picking a record, putting it on my turn table and listening to the small diamond needle scanning the grooves of the record pressed 30 or 40 years ago. This post is not about vinyl, though.\nToday I listen mostly to music on Spotify. It&rsquo;s cheap, offers good quality and is available both at home and at work.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2016/04/24/music-streaming-setup/","owner":"Antirez"}]
