[{"title":"Angular Continuous Deployment to Firebase Hosting using CircleCI","description":"<div class=\"bigInt\" itemprop=\"description\">Are you working with front-end applications like Angular, React, Vue etc.   Doing the production deployment is the most boring part. Because we need to do many manual steps to perform like npm install, ng test, build etc. This post will explain to how to automate all of these steps with CircleCI pipeline. Just push you changes to GitHub repository, and CircleCi take care everything. </div><br><div class=\"cen\"><img alt=\"Angular Continuous Deployment to Firebase Hosting using CircleCI\" class=\"sri650\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/srinivastamada/9lessonsImages/blob/master/angular-circle/angular-firebase.png?raw=true\"></div><br><a href=\"http://www.9lessons.info/2019/04/angular-deployment-firebase-circleci.html#more\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/9lesson?a=jB_8B8Jd9Cw:tHr_BPVgOSA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/9lesson?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/9lesson/~3/jB_8B8Jd9Cw/angular-deployment-firebase-circleci.html","owner":"Simon Reimler"},{"title":"Bitmoji is Now Live in the Venmo App!","description":null,"link":"http://blog.venmo.com/hf2t3h4x98p5e13z82pl8j66ngcmry/2019/5/2/bitmoji-is-now-live-in-the-venmo-app","owner":"Vena Solutions"},{"title":"Generating PDF Documents on the Fly Using Nodejs and Kue","description":"<div class=\"bigInt\" itemprop=\"description\">PDF documents are a very common form of hypermedia documents. Whether it’s books, bills, or invoices we consume PDF documents on a daily basis. In this article, we are going to learn how to generate PDF documents using Node.js and Worker queue called Kue. PDF generation is used in products such as E-commerce based applications, airline tickets, hotel booking, etc. We can use the same principle which I am going to show you below and apply it to implement the feature.</div><br><div class=\"cen\"><img alt=\"Generating PDF Documents on the Fly Using Nodejs and Kue\" class=\"sri650\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/srinivastamada/9lessonsImages/blob/master/node-pdf/node-pdf.png?raw=true\"></div><br><a href=\"http://www.9lessons.info/2019/04/generating-pdf-documents-on-fly-using.html#more\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/9lesson?a=PUyCKIpEHqs:Pj1h25pkMm4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/9l","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/9lesson/~3/PUyCKIpEHqs/generating-pdf-documents-on-fly-using.html","owner":"Simon Reimler"},{"title":"How to Improve Performance using Geo-Partitioning","description":"One of the most exciting features of distributed SQL is the ability to tie data to a specific location and CockroachDB delivers this capability via our geo-partitioning feature. If you aren&#x2019;t already familiar with this yet we&#x2019;ve recently published a few items that help explain how it works, including a&#xA0;video demo&#xA0;and a&#xA0;tutorial.
