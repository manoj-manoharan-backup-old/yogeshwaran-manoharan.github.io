[{"title":"Building Amazon Alexa Skills With Node.js, Revisited","description":"\n                    <p>A little more than two years ago, when the Amazon Echo first started picking up steam and when I was first exposed to virtual assistants, I had written a tutorial around creating a Skill for Amazon Alexa using Node.js and simple JavaScript. In this tutorial titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/create-amazon-alexa-skill-nodejs-aws-lambda/\">Create an Amazon Alexa Skill Using Node.js and AWS Lambda</a>, we saw how to create intent functions and sample utterances in preparation for deployment on AWS Lambda. I later wrote a tutorial titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/test-amazon-alexa-skills-offline-with-mocha-and-chai-for-node-js/\">Test Amazon Alexa Skills Offline with Mocha and Chai for Node.js</a>, which focused on building unit tests for these Skills and their intent functions. Fast forward to now and a few things have changed in the realm of Skill development.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to see ho","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/building-amazon-alexa-skills-nodejs-revisited/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Goroutine Leaks - The Forgotten Sender","description":"Introduction Concurrent programming allows developers to solve problems using more than one path of execution and is often used in an attempt to improve performance. Concurrency doesnâ€™t mean these multiple paths are executing in parallel; it means these paths are executing out-of-order instead of sequentially. Historically, this type of programming is facilitated using libraries that are either provided by a standard library or from 3rd party developers.\nIn Go, concurrency features like Goroutines and channels are built into the language and runtime to reduce or eliminate the need for libraries.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/11/goroutine-leaks-the-forgotten-sender.html","owner":"William Kennedy"},{"title":"Join us for the Global Day of Coderetreat on November 17th","description":"InVision is hosting a remote-friendly event for the Global Day of Coderetreat. GDCR is an opportunity to practice software development and design in a friendly and low-pressure environment. Come join us on Saturday November 17th starting at 10AM EST (UTC -5) and plan for a fun and enlightening day. There is no cost to participate in this event.\nWhat will we be doing for eight hours? After a quick introduction to the tooling for the day and some administrative words, participants will pair off into teams and begin a 45 minute coding session.","link":"https://engineering.invisionapp.com/post/global-day-of-coderetreat-2018/","owner":"InVision"},{"title":"The rise of multivector attacks","description":"","link":"https://idea.popcount.org/2018-11-12-the-rise-of-multivector-attacks","owner":"Marek Majkowski"}]
