[{"title":"An update on gobpf - ELF loading, uprobes, more program types","description":"Almost a year ago we introduced gobpf , a Go library to load and use eBPF programs from Go applications. Today we would like to give you a quick update on the changes and features added since then (i.e. the highlights of git log --oneline --no-merges --since=&quot;November 30th 2016&quot; master).\nLoad BPF programs from ELF object files With commit 869e637 , gobpf was split into two subpackages (github.com/iovisor/gobpf/bcc and github.com/iovisor/gobpf/elf) and learned to load BPF programs from ELF object files.","link":"/blog/2017/09/an-update-on-gobpf-elf-loading-uprobes-more-program-types/","owner":"Kinvolk"},{"title":"Introduction to Concurrency Models with Ruby.
