[{"title":"\nThanks Pivotal, Hello Redis Labs\n","description":"I consider myself very lucky for contributing to the open source. For me OSS software is not just a license: it means transparency in the development process, choices that are only taken in order to improve software from the point of view of the users, documentation that attempts to cover everything, and simple, understandable systems. The Redis community had the privilege of finding in Pivotal, and VMware before, a company that thinks at open source in the same way as we, the community of developers, think of it.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/91\n","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"}]
