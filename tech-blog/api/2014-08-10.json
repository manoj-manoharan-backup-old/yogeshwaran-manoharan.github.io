[{"title":"Internationalization And Localization With Ionic Framework And Angular Translate","description":"\n                    <p>There are roughly <a href=\"http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\">seven billion people in the world</a> (7,000,000,000) and roughly <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/askeds/many-spoken-languages.html\">6,500 languages</a>. Lucky for us, Android and iOS does not support all 6,500 of these languages. However, many are supported and this means that when you make an application in your native language, chances are your audience is only going to be a fraction of these people.</p>\n<p>Recently I discovered <a href=\"http://angular-translate.github.io/\">Angular Tranlate</a>, a JavaScript library for AngularJS. It allows you to create translation tables in your web application to quickly switch between depending on the language you desire. When you pair this with <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a>, which supports AngularJS, you have a great way of adding internationalization and localization into your mobile application.</p>\n           ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/08/internationalization-localization-ionicframework-angular-translate/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
