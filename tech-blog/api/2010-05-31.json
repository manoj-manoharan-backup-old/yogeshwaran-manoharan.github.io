[{"title":"Using X forwarding with screen by proxying $DISPLAY","description":"If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, I probably don&rsquo;t have to explain why I love GNU screen. I can keep a long-running session going on a server somewhere, and log in and resume my session without losing any state.\nI also love X-forwarding. I love being able to log into a remote server and work in a shell there, but still pop up graphical windows (for instance, gitk&rsquo;s) on my local machine when I need to.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/05/using-x-forwarding-with-screen/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
