[{"title":"Building a 64bit Docker OS for the Raspberry Pi 3","description":"<p>I&rsquo;m happy to announce the start of a &ldquo;short&rdquo; workshop were I&rsquo;m going through all the steps to build a complete 64bit operating system for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Lately I’ve been getting many requests for information on using a side drawer within the application. These side drawer components can improve the user experience significantly so I figured I would explore the topic.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to include a side drawer in our NativeScript Android and iOS application, built with Angular. To take things to the next level, we’re also going to include a feature rich list view as our core content.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/use-side-drawer-feature-rich-list-view-nativescript-angular-app/'>Use A Side Drawer And Feature Rich List View In A NativeScript Angular App</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeve","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/use-side-drawer-feature-rich-list-view-nativescript-angular-app/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
