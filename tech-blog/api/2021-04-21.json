Some of the visual design patterns we use include exposing and grouping information, allowing plenty of whitespace to separate distinct sections of data, and using indicators like icons to assist with scannability and information recognition. However visually pleasing these patterns may be, though, they are only truly successful when they help meet users’ needs.

I signed up for half a dozen waitlists on Monday—because a centralized, well-managed system for vaccinations doesn’t exist for some reason. Then heard that it’s better to go into individual pharmacies or call. On Tuesday, I walk into the local pharmacy and get an appointment booked for Wednesday. Sure enough, it is now Wednesday afternoon, less than a week after lamenting the inability to get a vaccine, and I have had my first shot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent much of yesterday thinking that I must’ve misheard or that there was a step that I must’ve missed along the way. I wasn’t <em>actually</em> going to get a shot today.
