[{"title":"Bundler + Passenger with Rails 2.3.5? Yes, please!","description":"Bundler allows you to define the gems your application uses, resolve dependencies and load everything up. This is great, because you don&rsquo;t have to manage all those different gem versions yourself any more.\nThere is a little problem, though. When you want to use Bundler with Rails 2.3.5. you need to do a bit of extra work.
