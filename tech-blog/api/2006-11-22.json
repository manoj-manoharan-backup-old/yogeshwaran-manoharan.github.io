[{"title":"Google Project Hosting: SourceForge Competitor","description":"I just found out that Google Code is now offering Project Hosting! It&rsquo;s in the same style as SourceForge, but the Google way!\nAs a Google user you can create a project with a built-in issue tracker and Subversion repository. And if that&rsquo;s not all, you can tie in a blog (at Blogger.com is you like) and adiscussion group (on Google Groups, of course).\nThis is really a nice package Google is offering and it looks like a serious competitor for SourceForge.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/11/22/google-project-hosting-sourceforge-competitor/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"SVN: How to fix bugs properly","description":"I&rsquo;ve already told you about releasing your project with help from Subversion. Now I want to talk to you about using Subversion to fix bugs in your application.\nFixing bugs can be as easy as fixing a few lines of code or as hard as rewriting a significant portion of your application.

Sometimes there are lots of comments and it&rsquo;s nice for visitors to see what the official reaction of the blog author is.\nSince I haven&rsquo;t really looked into a plugin or anything, this is just a very simple theme hack.\nYou can apply it to your current theme with almost no effort at all.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/11/22/wordpress-author-comment-highlighting/","owner":"Antirez"}]
