[{"title":"What do you want for AutoFlickr?","description":"Almost a month ago I published my WordPress plugin AutoFlickr, which shows one or more related photos from the popular Flickr site in your post.\nNow I&rsquo;m wondering what new features AutoFlickr users want. What parts of the current plugin are superfluous. Also, I&rsquo;d like to know how is using AutoFlickr?\nPlease post a comment with your wishes for AutoFlickr 1.1. People using AutoFlickr may contact me to let me know about their site.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/04/02/what-do-you-want-for-autoflickr/","owner":"Antirez"}]
