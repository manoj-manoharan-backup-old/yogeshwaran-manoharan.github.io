Today marks the beginning of Flatcar Container Linux as an independent Linux distribution. With this comes a certain responsibility, but more notably: an opportunity for Kinvolk and the broader container community.\nJust after the EOL announcement this February, Chris wrote a post about what this would mean for Kinvolk and the Flatcar project .
