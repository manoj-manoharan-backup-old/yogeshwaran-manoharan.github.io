[{"title":"One Dimensional Heat Equation via SUNDIALS and Haskell","description":"This is a short example of how to use SUNDIALS to solve a simple partial differential equation in Haskell via the hmatrix-sundials library. The example is taken from the C examples that come with the SUNDIALS source. Here’s the full blog. I’ll give a better URL soonish.","link":"https://idontgetoutmuch.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/one-dimensional-heat-equation-via-sundials-and-haskell/","owner":"Idontgetoutmuch's Weblog"},{"title":"Preparing for the Future with React Prereleases","description":null,"link":"https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html","owner":"React"},{"title":"Treat Testing Pain with a Healthy Dose of Test Strategy","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/retailmenot-engineering/treat-testing-pain-with-a-healthy-dose-of-test-strategy-43285deaad95?source=rss----d6bb34696ef5---4","owner":"RetailMeNot"}]
