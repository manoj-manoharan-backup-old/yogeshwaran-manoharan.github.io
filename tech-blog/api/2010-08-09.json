[{"title":"Rename a git branch","description":"In git, branching is cheap and easy. You do it all the time (you&rsquo;re not? Well, you should). Sometimes, though, you create a new feature branch, only to come to the conclusion later that the name you gave it does not cover the stuff you&rsquo;ve been doing.\nNo problem for git! Renaming a branch is really easy:\ngit branch -m old_branch new_branch That&rsquo;s all.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/08/09/rename-a-git-branch/","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Suggestion time: What should I blog about?","description":"I haven&rsquo;t been feeling very motivated to blog lately &ndash; I&rsquo;ve missed the last two weeks of Iron Blogger, and I&rsquo;m not totally enthusiastic about any of the items on my &ldquo;to blog&rdquo; list.\nBut, I do enjoy blogging when I actually get into posts, and I&rsquo;d like to keep updating this blog.

Later you can retrieve that content using the p or P commanands.\nOne thing that makes Vim more awesome than let&rsquo;s say, uhm TextMate, is that it actually has more than one clipboard! Yeah! In fact, in Vim terminology those clipboards are called registers.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/08/09/using-multiple-clipboards-in-vim/","owner":"Antirez"}]
