It is also a very good question that could be asked in a job interview for an engineering type position. I’m going to help you through it using Java.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/04/sort-an-integer-array-with-the-quicksor","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/04/sort-an-integer-array-with-the-quicksort-algorithm-and-java/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
