[{"title":"gRPC is easy to misconfigure","description":"<p>Google's <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\">gRPC</a> is an RPC system that supports many languages, and is relatively widely used. I think its popularity is due to being used for parts of Docker and Kubernetes. I think gRPC is mostly fine, but it is surprisingly easy to screw up by misconfiguring it. Part of that is because RPC systems are challenging to get right. They need to be useful for a wide variety of services, ranging from high request rate services that handle thousands of tiny requests each second, to services that need to transfer a lot of data, or servics with thousands of concurrent, slow requests that take minutes to complete. As a result, an RPC system like gRPC needs to be very configurable. Unfortunately, it is also pretty easy to configure it in a way that causes hard to understand errors.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of this blog post is going to describe two examples of annoying edge cases I ran into recently. I wasted about a day to debug and understand each of these.
