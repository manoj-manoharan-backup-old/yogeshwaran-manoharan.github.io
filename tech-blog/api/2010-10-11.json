Anyway, I&rsquo;d like to be able to create a VPN network between my home server and my MacbookPro, which might be anywhere in the world.\nThis first part of the tutorial describes how to setup a VPN server in Ubuntu. ~ First, install the pptpd package. pptpd offers a PPTP-type VPN which is supported by Microsoft and other network vendors.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/10/11/setup-a-ubuntu-vpn-server/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"},{"title":"Using Haskell's 'newtype' in C","description":"A common problem in software engineering is avoiding confusion and errors when dealing with multiple types of data that share the same representation. Classic examples include differentiating between measurements stored in different units, distinguishing between a string of HTML and a string of plain text (one of these needs to be encoded before it can safely be included in a web page!), or keeping track of pointers to physical memory or virtual memory when writing the lower layers of an operating system&rsquo;s memory management.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/10/using-haskells-newtype-in-c/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
