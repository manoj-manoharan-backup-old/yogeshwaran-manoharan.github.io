[{"title":"Record IP Camera Surveillance Video With A Raspberry Pi","description":"\n                    <p>As some of you may know, I have wireless surveillance cameras around my home. Many years back I even released an Android application called SpyFi to be able to view the video feed from these cameras. Up until recently I would have these cameras upload a sequence of images to a remote FTP server every time there was motion. The problem with this is that these were only a sequence of still-images rather than video, and the server was not free or necessarily cheap.</p>\n<p>Being that I own a few Raspberry Pi computers, I figured it might be a good idea to utilize them for surveillance storage. The cool thing about this approach is that it is cheaper and that I can record video rather than pictures.</p>\n<p>We’re going to take a look at how I’m recording video on a Raspberry Pi device to keep my home safe.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/09/record-camera-surveillance-video-r","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/09/record-camera-surveillance-video-raspberry-pi/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
