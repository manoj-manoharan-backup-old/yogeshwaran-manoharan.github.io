[{"title":"Security doesn't respect abstraction boundaries","description":"The fundamental tool of any engineering discipline is the notion of abstraction. If we can build a set of useful, easily-described behaviors out of a complex system, we can build other systems on top of those pieces, without having to understand to worry about the full complexity of the underlying system. Without this notion of abstracting away complexity, we'd be stuck writing our webapps in assembly code &ndash; if not toggling them in to our frontpanels after painstakingly translating them into hex by hand.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/03/security-doesnt-respect-abstraction/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
