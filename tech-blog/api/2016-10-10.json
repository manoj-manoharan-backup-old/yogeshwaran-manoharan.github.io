[{"title":"Upgrading Your Hybrid Apps To Native With NativeScript","description":"\n                    <p>As someone who has developed both hybrid web applications and native applications, I understand the differences and advantages each brings to the table. While I agree that you can do some pretty neat things with a hybrid web application built with frameworks like Ionic, I no longer think it is as great of a solution as it once was.</p>\n<p>With hybrid web frameworks like <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic 2</a> and native mobile frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> both using Angular, you have to step back and ask yourself what you’re truly getting as an advantage as of now in hybrid. Performance is one of many reasons why native still makes more sense, and being able to use Angular, why wouldn’t you?</p>\n<p>This is why I spent a lot of time creating an upgrade guide to demonstrate how to take your hybrid mobile application built with Ionic 2 and Angular to native with NativeScript and Angular.</p>\n                    ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/10/upgrading-hybrid-apps-native-nativescript/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
