[{"title":"RSpec'ing with Time.now","description":"I&rsquo;m currently writing some RSpec tests that use Time.now.\nI want my model to calculate a duration and store the future time in the database. I&rsquo;ve already specced the calculation of the duration, but I also want to spec that everything gets saved correctly. Here&rsquo;s my first spec:\nit &#34;should do stuff&#34; do m = Model.create() m.expires_at.should eql(Time.now + some_value) end This fails.\nIt fails because Time.now is quite accurate and some milliseconds have passed between the two calls.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/11/05/rspecing-with-timenow/","owner":"Antirez"}]
