[{"title":"Narf: A Ruby Micro Test Framework","description":"I&rsquo;m a happy user of RSpec, Cucumber and sometimes Steak. Great tools to write specs and features and prove my application does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. But sometimes I have the need for something more light weight. ~ For example, sometimes I need to write a single ruby method. Just something &lsquo;quick&rsquo; to import a file, convert some data or whatever. Being a good citizen I want to test that method.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/02/11/narf-a-ruby-micro-test-framework/","owner":"Antirez"}]
