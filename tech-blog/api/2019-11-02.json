[{"title":"Why Bazel?","description":"In this post, we&rsquo;ll cover what Bazel is, how to use it, and why I chose to use it.\nWhat is Bazel? Bazel is a build-system released by Google in 2015. It actually is derived from the internal build-system Google uses internally for most of its own code-base, called Blaze.\nBuilding at scale Bazel has a huge focus on hermetic builds, and reproducibility. Every build step is, from a really broad perspective, defined as a list of inputs, tools, and outputs.","link":"https://enoent.fr/posts/why-bazel/","owner":"Manu Sporny"}]
