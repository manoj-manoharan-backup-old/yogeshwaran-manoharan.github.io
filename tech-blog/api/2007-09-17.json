I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be giving a full, in-detail report of everything that happens, but I will let you know anything worth your (and my) time.\nIf you happen to be in Berlin these days, feel free to drop me an e-mail at ariejan at ariejan.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/09/17/railsconf-europe-2007/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
