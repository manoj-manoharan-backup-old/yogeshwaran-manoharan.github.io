[{"title":"Use MavensMate with Sublime Text for Apex Development","description":"\n                    <p>After attending the <a href=\"http://www.dreamforce.com/\">Dreamforce</a> conference for <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/\">Salesforce</a> development, I thought I’d share how to develop in <a href=\"https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Apex\">Apex</a> using Sublime Text rather than Eclipse.</p>\n<p>If you’re familiar with my development styles, you know that I am very against using IDE applications because of their sluggishness. Everyone will have their own opinions, but I much prefer Sublime Text over Eclipse for all development. Lucky for us, there is an awesome package for us called <a href=\"http://mavensmate.com/\">MavensMate</a>, that lets us do Apex coding directly in Sublime Text.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/11/use-mavensmate-sublime-text-apex-development/'>Use MavensMate with Sublime Text for Apex Development</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='http","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/11/use-mavensmate-sublime-text-apex-development/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
