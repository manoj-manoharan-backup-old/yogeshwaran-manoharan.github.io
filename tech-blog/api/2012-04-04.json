Acapela Group offers amazing text to speech solutions\nand have a variety of SDKs\nso you can write apps that create sound files using one of their voices (including\nhip-hop and country!). Take a listen to some sample voices. Weâ€™re calling on our developer community to mashup SoundCloud and Acapela. Show\nus what you can do using a text to speech service with the best audio content\nplatform on the web. Maybe you want to have your email read (or sung!) to you\nlayered on some instrumental or drum tracks.
