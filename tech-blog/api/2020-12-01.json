Let’s change that and make it look better! Here are a few simple steps to create bathymetry vector tiles with <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/\">MapTiler Desktop</a> and map the ocean depths on <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/\">MapTiler Cloud</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"creating-bathymetry-vectortiles\">Creating bathymetry vector tiles</h2>\n<p>Ocean depth data can be found on the bathymetry section of the NaturalEarth website. Global nested polygons are <a href=\"https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-bathymetry/\">downloaded</a> as individual shapefiles, each of them coming with a DEPTH attribute from 0 to -10000 meters.</p>\n\n<amp-youtube data-videoid=\"M675nN2EfxE\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"16\" height=\"9\"","link":"https://www.maptiler.com/news/2020/12/building-an-ocean-vector-map-with-maptiler/","owner":"MapTiler"},{"title":"Growing the Hardcaml toolset","description":"<p>I am pleased to announce that we have recently released a slew of new\nHardcaml libraries!</p>\n\n","link":"https://blog.janestreet.com/growing-the-hardcaml-toolset-index/","owner":"Jane Street"},{"title":"Introducing the New Evernote for Android","description":null,"link":"https://evernote.com/blog/new-evernote-android/","owner":"Evernote"},{"title":"Lessons from the AWS Kinesis Outage","description":"<p>I love reading post-mortem analyses, because there is a lot to learn both about how systems are designed, and how they fail. On November 25th 2020, AWS Kinesis had a 17 hour outage that affected other AWS services, and customer services built on top of AWS. The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/\">post-mortem is excellent, with a lot of interesting details about how this service, and other services at AWS work</a>. I wrote myself some notes with the lessons I think we can learn from this outage. I would like to point out that this does not mean I think the AWS teams did a bad job in any way. It is very easy to point out weaknesses after something has failed. It is much harder to figure out which of the infinite weaknesses in a system you should prioritize in advance. However, we should try our best to learn from examples like this, to attempt to be able to predict how things will fail in the future, and get better and handling the inevitable failures that do occur.</p>\n\n<","link":"https://www.evanjones.ca/kinesis-outage.html","owner":"Evan Jones"},{"title":"Open Sourcing Kanvas: Tumblr’s Media Editor and CameraToday, Tumblr is releasing Kanvas, the Media...","description":"<h1>Open Sourcing Kanvas: Tumblr’s Media Editor and Camera</h1><p>Today, Tumblr is releasing <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftumblr%2Fkanvas-ios&amp;t=MTFmM2QzNmJiZWU0OTYwNTMxMzIyZDEwM2Q3ZmIxMWVkMzlhYWFmNSxjY2E3NTEyYzk4OGZkN2ZjMWZlMjg2NmVhNTYxZGEwMzI2Njc2ZTZm&amp;ts=1606775733\">Kanvas</a>, the Media Editor and Camera used in the <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftumblr%2Fid305343404&amp;t=OGQ0YWQwNDI0Y2FhZjk2NWJmYmRkY2JlNmFkODgyNTE4NjY3NmFlYixiNmY0Y2ZjMTgxODMwYjczNzdjN2UwOTA1YmI3MzA1YjU5MDFiMjE1&amp;ts=1606795505\">Tumblr iOS app</a>, as open-source!</p><p class=\"npf_chat\"><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftumblr%2Fkanvas-ios&amp;t=MTFmM2QzNmJiZWU0OTYwNTMxMzIyZDEwM2Q3ZmIxMWVkMzlhYWFmNSxjY2E3NTEyYzk4OGZkN2ZjMWZlMjg2NmVhNTYxZGEwMzI2Njc2ZTZm&amp;ts=1606775733\">https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios</a></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=","link":"https://engineering.tumblr.com/post/636319413627453440","owner":"Tumblr"},{"title":"Predicting New Sort Performance When Data is Sparse / Missing","description":"Goal At Wayfair, we want to predict the performance of new sorting algorithms before we launch them.
