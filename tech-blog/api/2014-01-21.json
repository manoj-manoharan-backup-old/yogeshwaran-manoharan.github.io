[{"title":"Decode JSON Documents In Go","description":"Introduction\nWe are working on a project where we have to make calls into a web service. Many of the web calls return very large documents that contain many sub-documents. The worst part is, we usually only need a handful of the fields for any given document and those fields tend to be scattered all over the place.\nHere is a sample of a smaller document:\nvar document string = {&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;userContext&amp;quot;: {&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;conversationCredentials&amp;quot;: {&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;sessionToken&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;06142010_1:75bf6a413327dd71ebe8f3f30c5a4210a9b11e93c028d6e11abfca7ff&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; },&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot;: true,&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;isPasswordExpired&amp;quot;: false,&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;cobrandId&amp;quot;: 10000004,&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;channelId","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/01/decode-json-documents-in-go.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"},{"title":"Introducing CodePlayer - watch your code like a movie","description":"\n<p>Ever thought of sharing solution of a coding problem in form of a video with\nsomeone, to teach them how you implemented the solution.
