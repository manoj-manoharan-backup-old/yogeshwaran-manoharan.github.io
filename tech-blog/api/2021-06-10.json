Value stream mapping—which provides a visual representation that makes it easy to track changes, detect stalled or delayed changes, identify failures or blockages and view contributing components—would provide those organizations with full visibility into their software delivery processes so they can analyze and improve them.","link":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/forrester-study-key-capabilities-for-mature-software-delivery","owner":"CloudBees"},{"title":"GFN Thursday Highlights Legendary Moments From the New Season of Apex Legends","description":null,"link":"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/10/geforce-now-thursday-june-10/","owner":"Nvidia"},{"title":"Heart Rate Zone Calculator","description":null,"link":"https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/calculating-your-max-and-target-heart-rate-zone/","owner":"Runtastic"},{"title":"How ‘Latinx’ Is Leading The Resistance Against Gendered Languages","description":null,"link":"https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-latinx-is-leading-resistance-against-gendered-languages","owner":"Babbel"},{"title":"How Clever Secures Infrastructure Secrets Using AWS SSM Parameter Store","description":null,"link":"https://engineering.clever.com/2021/06/09/how-clever-secures-infrastructure-secrets-using-aws-ssm-parameter-store/","owner":"Clever"},{"title":"How I Went About Learning A Language From Scratch","description":null,"link":"https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/learning-a-language-from-scratch","owner":"Babbel"},{"title":"How to start the digital transformation of your business?","description":"The digital transformation doesn’t just refer to adopting new technologies; it’s also about changing your approach to business.
