[{"title":"IE8 Bug in bitwise operators for JavaScript","description":"<p>This will be a very quick entry: I just wanted to report a bug I\ndiscovered in IE8 that I could not find any information about.  IE8\nappears to have a bug with its bitwise operators in JavaScript (right\nshift, unsigned right shift, and bitwise or â€“ maybe more). The bug\nis: whenever the left operand is greater or equal to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2^63</code>, the\noperator returns zero.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if the operand has its high bit set when converted to\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">uint64</code>, these operators will return 0 instead of their correct\nvalue.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few quick test cases:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\" data-lang=\"javascript\"><span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">18446744073709550000</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span","link":"https://blog.reverberate.org/2015/10/ie8-bug-in-bitwise-operators-for.html","owner":"Jonathan Snook"}]
