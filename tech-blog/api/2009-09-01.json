[{"title":"JInput Mac OS X 64 bit natives","description":"<p>Yesterday I ran into a little problem running <a href=\"http://slick.cokeandcode.com/index.php\">Slick 2D</a> on Java 6 64bit on my Mac. It&rsquo;s a MacPro, which has a 64 bit processor and is running Leopard. The problem I encountered was related to the native libraries provided by <a href=\"http://www.lwjgl.org\">LWJGL</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a user of LWJGL, you&rsquo;ll be using JInput as well. Unfortunately, JInput does not currently have any 64 bit native libraries as it is only providing for PPC and i386 (32bit). This is a problem because Mac OS X users are somewhat bound to Java 6 64bit. There is no 32 bit version of Java 6 for Mac OS X.</p>","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/09/01/jinput-mac-os-x-64-bit-natives/","owner":"Antirez"}]
