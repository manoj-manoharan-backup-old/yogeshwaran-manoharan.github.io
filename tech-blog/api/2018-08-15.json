[{"title":"Use The ChromeiQL Extension For Google Chrome To Test GraphQL Queries","description":"\n                    <p>As you probably know, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot with GraphQL recently. I&rsquo;ve released tutorials that include <a href=\"https://blog.couchbase.com/processing-graphql-queries-with-java-spring-boot-and-nosql/\">Java with GraphQL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/05/getting-started-graphql-development-nodejs/\">Node.js with GraphQL</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/05/getting-started-graphql-golang/\">Golang with GraphQL</a>, but I&rsquo;ve only ever demonstrated testing those GraphQL APIs with cURL. If you&rsquo;ve ever used cURL for anything, not specific to GraphQL, you&rsquo;ll know it works well, but it isn&rsquo;t the most friendly tool available.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to look at an alternative method to testing GraphQL queries using a convenient Google Chrome extension called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij\">ChromeiQL</a>.</p>\n           ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/08/use-chromeiql-extension-google-chrome-test-graphql-queries/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
