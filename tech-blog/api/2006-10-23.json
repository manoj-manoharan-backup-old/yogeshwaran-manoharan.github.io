[{"title":"Ruby On Rails for PHP: CakePHP","description":"The framework has been around for some time, but I found out about it a few days ago: CakePHP.\nI&rsquo;ve been using Ruby on Rails for quite some time now. It&rsquo;s a very cool framework and it&rsquo;s fun to work with. However, there&rsquo;s one big problem I have with it: I can&rsquo;t host it anywhere!\nWell, there are several hosting companies that offer Rails hosting, but the price is pretty steep when compared to my current hosting plan.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/10/23/ruby-on-rails-for-php-cakephp/","owner":"Antirez"}]
