[{"title":"reptyr: Attach a running process to a new terminal","description":"Over the last week, I&rsquo;ve written a nifty tool that I call reptyr. reptyr is a utility for taking an existing running program and attaching it to a new terminal. Started a long-running process over ssh, but have to leave and don&rsquo;t want to interrupt it? Just start a screen, use reptyr to grab it, and then kill the ssh session and head on home.\nYou can grab the source, or read on for some more details.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/01/reptyr-attach-a-running-process-to-a-new-terminal/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
