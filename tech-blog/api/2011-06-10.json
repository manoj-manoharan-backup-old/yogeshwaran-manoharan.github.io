[{"title":"Vows and CoffeeScript","description":"CoffeeScript is a really nice way to write JavaScript code. Combined with NodeJS you are empowered by a very fast platform to develop server-side applications. Of course, you want to test these apps as well. Vows is really great way to do this. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not straight forward (yet) to set up NodeJS + CoffeeScript + Vows.\n~ First off, make sure you have CoffeeScript and Vows installed. Here I install them globally so you can use the coffee and vows command line utilities.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/06/10/vows-and-coffeescript/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
