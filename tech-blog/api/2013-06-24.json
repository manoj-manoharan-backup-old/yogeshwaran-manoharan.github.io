[{"title":"Running Go Programs as a Background Process","description":"I have been writing Windows services in C/C++ and then in C# since 1999. Now that I am writing server based software in Go for the Linux OS I am completely lost. What is even more&nbsp;frustrating,&nbsp;is that for the first time the OS I am developing on (Mac OSX) is not the operating system I will be deploying my code on. That will be for another blog post.\nI want to run my code as a background process (daemon) on my Mac.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/06/running-go-programs-as-background.html","owner":"Wilfred Hughes"}]
