[{"title":"How to setup a Ubuntu development server - Part 1","description":"Since I&rsquo;m starting some real work on my final school project, I want to install a Ubuntu development server here at home. I have a Pentium 4 box here that will perform that task.\nIn this first part I will show you how to install Subversion over WebDAV. All of this will be done in such a way that it&rsquo;s easy to serve multiple projects at once.\nIn future parts I will tell you more about installing Trac, FastCGI (with Apache) to host Rails applications and how to use Capistrano to deploy your app properly.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/12/01/how-to-setup-a-ubuntu-development-server-part-1/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
