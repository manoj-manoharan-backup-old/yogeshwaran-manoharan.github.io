[{"title":"JIT version determining in runtime","description":"<p>Sometimes I want to know used JIT compiler version in my little C# experiments. It is clear that it is possible to determine the version in advance based on the environment. However, sometimes I want to know it in runtime to perform specific code for the current JIT compiler. More formally, I want to get the value from the following enum:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-cs\" data-lang=\"cs\"><span class=\"k\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"n\">JitVersion</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Mono</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">MsX86</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">MsX64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">RyuJit</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>It is easy to detect Mono by existing of the <code>Mono.Runtime</code> class. Otherwise, we can assume that we work with Microsoft JIT implementation.
