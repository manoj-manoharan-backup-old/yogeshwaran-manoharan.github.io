[{"title":"A week with the iPhone","description":"I&rsquo;ve had a new iPhone for about a week now, so I figure it&rsquo;s time to write up some thoughts about it.\nFirst, the little things. It is, in typical Apple fashion, an incredibly slick piece of work. Scrolling and zooming images or webpages is simple, easy, and, well, just fun to do and watch. Mobile Safari does a great job of making full webpages usable on the tiny screen.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2007/12/a-week-with-the-iphone/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"Write a DVD-Video from the Linux console","description":"This is probably my last post for this year, and it&rsquo;s not about Ruby on Rails! Or web development! It&rsquo;s about how to burn a DVD-Video from the Linux console.\nI know, there are tons of fancy apps (with a decent GUI) that allow you to create DVD-Video disks from Gnome or KDE. But, my Linux machine has no monitor attached and I don&rsquo;t care for hogging up resources by running X.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/12/31/write-a-dvd-video-from-the-linux-console/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
