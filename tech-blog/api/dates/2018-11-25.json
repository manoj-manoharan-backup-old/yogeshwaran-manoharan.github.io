In case you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with 2FA, there are numerous approaches ranging from HMAC-based one-time passwords (HOTP) and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) which are software based, to the hardware based universal two-factor (U2F) standard.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been keeping up with the blog, you&rsquo;ll remember I had written a tutorial titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/implement-2fa-time-based-one-time-passwords-node-js-api/\">Implement 2FA with Time-Based One-Time Passwords in a Node.js API</a>, which focused on the software side of things. I recently picked up some YubiKey dongles and thought I&rsquo;d try my luck with the hardware side of things.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&rs","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/u2f-authentication-yubikey-nodejs-jquery/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
