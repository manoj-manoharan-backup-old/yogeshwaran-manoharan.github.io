Ideally, the chosen platform permeates throughout the ranks of the organization instead of having fractured communication between members. The real-time and group collaborative nature of these messaging platforms are quite appealing.</p>\n\n<p>I have personally used a couple of messaging platform so far (i.e., Hipchat, Gitter, Discord, Slack). Overall, they all offer the concept of channels. Channels are simply persisted chat <em>rooms</em> in which members can communicate asynchronously. Topics and names of channels are left up to the members who use them.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to outline some steps to better foster an effective use of channels in your messaging platform of choice.","link":"https://techblog.thescore.com/2017/06/30/make-the-most-of-your-chat-channels/","owner":"theScore"}]
