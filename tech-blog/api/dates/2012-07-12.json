[{"title":"Recording and Sharing Phone Calls","description":"A few weeks ago, I attended News Hack Day in San Francisco.\nNews Hack Days are events that bring together journalists, developers and designers for multi\nday creative coding and brainstorming sessions. I really like the idea of hack days that bring together people from different backgrounds. After\nchatting with a few journalists, it became obvious to me that recording interviews on the phone\nis a real pain. I saw this as an opportunity to build a fun app that would make this easier for\npeople.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/recording-and-sharing-phone-calls","owner":"Soundcloud"}]
