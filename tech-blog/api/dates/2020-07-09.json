During this time, I focused on improving the algorithm behind some of CockroachDB&#x2019;s SQL operators, to reduce memory usage and speed up query execution. In this blog post, I will go over the improvements that I made to the algorithm behind the unordered distinct operator, as well as new algorithms that address some existing inefficiencies.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/unordered-distinct-vectorized-engine/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"iOS App Architecture for Web Developers","description":"","link":"https://devblog.songkick.com/ios-app-architecture-for-web-developers-f61ded0ef427?source=rss----e0e3c74f91b8---4","owner":"Songkick"}]
