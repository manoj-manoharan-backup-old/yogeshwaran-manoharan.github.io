[{"title":"NativeScript For The Angular Developer","description":"\n                    <p>After months of receiving requests, I am finally pleased to announce that my course, <strong>NativeScript for the Angular Developer</strong>, is now available on <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/nativescript-for-the-angular-2-developer/?couponCode=ANGULARNATIVE\">Udemy</a>. This Angular and <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> course is similar to the previous course I released titled, <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/nativescript-101-a-quickstart-to-building-mobile-apps/?couponCode=DEALME5\">NativeScript 101</a>, with the exception that this time we’re using Angular instead of vanilla JavaScript. If you’re unfamiliar with NativeScript, it is a cross platform framework for developing native mobile applications. There needs to be emphasis on the native part because you’re not building hybrid web applications, you’re building native mobile applications.</p>\n<p>So what can you hope to accomplish in this particular course?</p>\n                    \n    ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/11/nativescript-angular-2-developer/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Weekly Programming Challenges -- Recap","description":"Recapping the last 16 weeks of weekly programming challenges\r\n — 2-minute read<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/buckblog/~4/Tag4iGFKrAs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","link":"http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/11/19/weekly-programming-challenge-summary.html","owner":"Jamis Buck"}]
