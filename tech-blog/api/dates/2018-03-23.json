[{"title":"Interface Values Are Valueless","description":"Introduction I’ve been seeing a lot of question about interfaces lately on Slack. Most of the time the answers are technical and focus on implementation details. Implementation is important to help with debugging, but implementation doesn’t help with design. When it comes to designing code with interfaces, behavior has to be the main focus.\nIn this post, I hope to provide a different way to think about interfaces and how to design code with them.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/03/interface-values-are-valueless.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
