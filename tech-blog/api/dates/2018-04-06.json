[{"title":"CSS Color Dingbats","description":"Before emoji, there were dingbats. In the CSS Color Emoji, you may see some of the glyphs render in black-and-white. These are the old dingbats and sometimes font stacks render them before the color emoji fonts are used. This is especially true for macOS and linux. For iOS and Windows, rendering seems to default to color and everything works correctly. It can vary depending on your font stack, the browser, and the OS and it’s only a few characters that are affected.","link":"https://www.client9.com/css-color-dingbats/","owner":"Nick Galbreath"},{"title":"Picking Trending Topics and Celebrities Using Machine Learning","description":"The Data Intelligence team at Condé Nast use Machine Learning to build a predictive model for the search traffic different topics drive","link":"https://technology.condenast.com/story/picking-trending-topics-and-celebrities-using-machine-learning","owner":"Condé Nast"},{"title":"The Stack Overflow Age","description":"I want to catch you all up on some stuff but mostly I want to tell the story of Stack Overflow in a not-completely-disorganized way.
