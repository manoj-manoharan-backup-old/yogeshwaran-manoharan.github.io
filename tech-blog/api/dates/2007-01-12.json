[{"title":"Rails: Group results by week (using group_by)","description":"The Enumerable class in Rails contains a method named &lsquo;group_by&rsquo;. This method is pure magic for a developer&rsquo;s point of view. I&rsquo;ll give you a simple example that shows the power of group_by.\nLet&rsquo;s say you have a table &lsquo;posts&rsquo; containing blog posts. Now, you normally show these chronologically a few at a time. Nothing special there. For some special overview page, you want to group your posts by week.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/01/12/rails-group-results-by-week-using-group_by/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
