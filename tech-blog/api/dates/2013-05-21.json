[{"title":"\nAvailability on planet Terah\n","description":"Terah is a planet far away, where networks never split. They have a single issue with their computer networks, from time to time, single hosts break in a way or the other. Sometimes is a broken power supply, other times a crashed disk, or a software issue completely blocking the system.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/57\n","owner":"Antirez"},{"title":"Early Birds","description":"Over the years I&rsquo;ve often found myself behind my computer at two in the morning trying to finish a feature for a side-project and trying to keep my eyes open and focussed.\nAfter a hack session until two or three in the morning, there would be a price to pay in the morning. Not even three alarms would wake me and I&rsquo;d be grumpy all day long. The feature I wrote the evening before didn&rsquo;t even look that good, so I&rsquo;d be re-written or removed altogether.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2013/05/21/early-birds/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
