[{"title":"Feature of the Week: Core Changefeeds in CockroachDB 19.1","description":"Our latest CockroachDB Feature of the Week, core changefeeds, is an exciting new way for event-driven apps to consume data from CockroachDB. With the CHANGEFEED FORstatement, a SQL client can tell the database to monitor a table and tell it when writes take place. CockroachDB will then hold the connection open until the client closes it and stream records to the client for all writes. You can use changefeeds to build event-driven applications, perform data integration, and do all kinds of other tasks that depend on watching the state of a table.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/feature-of-the-week-core-changefeeds-in-cockroachdb-19-1/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
