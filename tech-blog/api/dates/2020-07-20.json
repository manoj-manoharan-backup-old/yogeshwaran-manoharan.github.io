[{"title":"Reply via Email","description":"<p>While I don’t blog nearly as often as I used to and while I removed comments from my site a few years back due to lack of use and the constant barrage of spam, it <em>is</em> nice to hear from people that either have something nice to say, have a helpful critique, or want to have a dialogue on an interesting topic. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/replyin/\">others</a> have done, I’ve added a “Reply via email” mailto link at the bottom of each article in my RSS feed to making conversation a little bit easier. (I also added the same thing on <a href=\"https://nook.snook.ca\">The Nook</a>, for you whisky-minded individuals.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m still a fan of RSS, even if I’m not as prolific as I once was. </p><hr><small><a href=\"mailto:snookca@snk.ms\">Reply via email</a></small>","link":"http://snook.ca/archives/rss/reply-via-email","owner":"Jonathan Snook"},{"title":"Restrict SSH to rsync for deploying files with GitHub Actions","description":null,"link":"https://www.schakko.de/2020/07/20/restrict-ssh-to-rsync-for-deploying-files-with-github-actions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=restrict-ssh-to-rsync-for-deploying-files-with-github-actions","owner":"Schakko"}]
