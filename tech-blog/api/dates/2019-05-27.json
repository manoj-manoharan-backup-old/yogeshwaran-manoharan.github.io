[{"title":"Monitoring GPS Data with the NEO 6M and Arduino","description":"\n                    <p>I recently wrote a tutorial titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/05/configuring-visual-studio-code-arduino-development/\">Configuring Visual Studio Code for Arduino Development</a>, because I&rsquo;ve been exploring the Internet of Things (IoT). Up until recently I&rsquo;ve only had hands on experience with <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/tags/raspberry-pi/\">Raspberry Pi</a>, but I&rsquo;ve been expanding my knowledge with Arduino.</p>\n<p>I have an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JJYYqA\">Arduino Uno</a> and a GPS module, so I thought it&rsquo;d be a good idea to demonstrate how to use the two together.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to see how to monitor a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JESUzw\">NEO 6M</a> GPS module connected to an Arduino using a few lines of very simple code.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/05/monitoring-gps-data-ne","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/05/monitoring-gps-data-neo-6m-arduino/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
