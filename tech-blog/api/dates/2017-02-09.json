At that point in development, we merely provided a functional proof of concept that was severely limited performance-wise.\nThis is changing, gradually.\nWe are preparing to launch CockroachDB 1.0 later this spring, and SQL joins in CockroachDB 1.0 will be usable, if underpowered.\nimg{display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}b a{font-weight:bold!important;} The story in the&#xA0;infographic above is that we are working to make SQL joins perform better than the naive code we presented in July 2016.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/better-sql-joins-in-cockroachdb/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"TPDP Episode #12: Getting the Developer Help You Need, Online","description":"\n                    <p>I am pleased to announce that the latest episode of The Polyglot Developer Podcast has been released to popular podcasting networks such as, but not limited to, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/polyglot-developer-podcast/id1070975158\">iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://pca.st/qXBc\">Pocket Casts</a>. In this episode titled, <strong>Getting the Help You Need on Stack Overflow, Blogs, and Forum Boards</strong>, I revisit something I had discussed on this blog a few years back. The subject is on getting developer help, online.</p>\n<p>Back in 2015 I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/10/how-to-get-programming-help-in-forums-and-on-my-blog/\">the best ways to seek help</a> on The Polyglot Developer. Both the podcast episode and blog post were inspired by a common set of questions that I would receive in the comments section of the blog. The common set of questions lack important information required to give a quality response.</p>\n  ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/02/tpdp-episode-12-getting-developer-help-need-online/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
