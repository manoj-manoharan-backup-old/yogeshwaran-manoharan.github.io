[{"title":"The Window Manager I Want","description":"Since I first discovered ratpoison in 2005 or so, I've basically exclusively used tiling window managers, going through, over the years, StumpWM, Ion 3, and finally XMonad. They've all had various strengths and weaknesses, but I've never been totally happy with any of them. This blog entry is a writeup of what I want to see as a window manager. It's possible that some day I'll get annoyed enough to write it, but maybe this post will inspire someone else to (Not likely, but I can hope).","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/05/the-window-manager-i-want/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
