[{"title":"SocialFolders Releases SoundCloud Ruby Gem","description":"There are many approaches to building libraries that wrap HTTP APIs. For many of our\nofficially supported SDKs we\nchose to build light wrappers around HTTP client libraries with a few added features\nto make it easier to work with the SoundCloud API. This approach has a few benefits.\nIt guarantees a certain consistency and is relatively easy to maintain. It’s also fairly\nfuture proof. Changes in the HTTP API do not typically require updates to client libraries. Sometimes however, you might be looking for something a bit more feature-full, or with\nmore abstraction from our HTTP API. That’s why I was really happy to see that the great folks at\nSocialFolders built an alternative SoundCloud Ruby gem and\nreleased it to the public. You can check out their blog post\nabout it or go straight to the source on GitHub.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/socialfolders-releases-soundcloud-gem","owner":"Soundcloud"}]
