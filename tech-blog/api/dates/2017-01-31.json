[{"title":"Develop Your Design Philosophy","description":"Prelude This post is part of a series of posts designed to make you think about your own design philosophy on different topics. I will not be laying out direct examples to prove my own thoughts and ideas. It takes me two or three days in the classroom to do that and itâ€™s why I think my classes are so special.\nMy goal is to get you and others to write the next set of blog posts to prove or disprove these ideas.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/01/develop-your-design-philosophy.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
