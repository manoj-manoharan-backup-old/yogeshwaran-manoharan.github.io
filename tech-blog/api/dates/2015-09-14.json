[{"title":"Support iBeacons In Your Ionic Framework Mobile App","description":"\n                    <p>I recently picked up some <a href=\"http://estimote.com/\">Estimote iBeacons</a> to play around with and figured I’d try to get them working in an <a href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com/\">Ionic Framework</a> Android and iOS application.</p>\n<p>If you’re unfamiliar with iBeacons, they are small bluetooth proximity devices. There are many different manufacturers, but Estimote appears to have the best advertised battery life and durability. iBeacons generally broadcast a signal every 100ms to 1000ms depending on the configuration or brand. The broadcast signal contains a UUID and two numeric identifiers which are a major and minor version.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the code I’ll share a few possible use cases for iBeacons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Triggering some literature or audio when your device detects that you’re near a particular iBeacon in a museum. Put one near The Statue of David in Italy and bam, you could have information about it when you approach it.</li>\n<li>Track","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/09/support-ibeacons-in-your-ionic-framework-mobile-app/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
