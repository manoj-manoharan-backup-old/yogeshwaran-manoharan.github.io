[{"title":"Why Diablo 3's DRM is the best kind there is","description":"I just tried to play Diablo 3, but could not log on due to server maintenance. Blizzard requires you to be always online to play even single player campaigns. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people rage about this, but Blizzard actually has very good reasons to do this. And they even kept you, as a player, in mind!\nFirst of all, what Blizzard is doing is not really DRM.\nDigital Rights Management is making sure you have authorization (from the providing party) to do something off-line.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/05/20/why-diablo-3-s-drm-is-the-best-kind-there-is/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
