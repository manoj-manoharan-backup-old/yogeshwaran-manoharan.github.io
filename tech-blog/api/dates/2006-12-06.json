[{"title":"Install ruby-mysql on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger","description":"<p>You probably know that the built-in mysql code in Rails sucks. To rephrase that, the ruby-mysql gem contains better code, so you want that. Rails automatically detects if you have ruby-mysql installed or not, and uses it if you have it.</p>\n<p>Most notably, you want to install this gem if you get dropped MySQL connections running your Rails application.</p>\n<p>So we do:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">$ sudo gem install mysql\n...\nERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.</pre>\n<p>Normall this would install fine, but not on Mac OS X. This is because Mac OS X keeps its code, headers and libraries in odd places (compared to Linux). But don&rsquo;t panic. There&rsquo;s an easy solution to all this!</p>","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/12/06/install-ruby-mysql-on-mac-os-x-104-tiger/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
