In comparison to virtual machines, containers a lot easier to maintain and are more lightweight. While working with containers are great, their true power aren’t made visible until you start clustering them. There are a few clustering and orchestration options, the most popular being Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.</p>\n<p>In this guide we’re going to see how to create a simple Docker Swarm cluster on several server nodes that consist of both manager nodes and worker nodes.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/04/create-cluster-microservice-containers-docker-swarm/'>Create A Cluster Of Microservice Containers With Docker Swarm</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n          ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/04/create-cluster-microservice-containers-docker-swarm/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Managing Django’s settings","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/wemake-services/managing-djangos-settings-e2b7f496120d?source=rss----3ac85505f67d---4","owner":"Wemake.services"}]
