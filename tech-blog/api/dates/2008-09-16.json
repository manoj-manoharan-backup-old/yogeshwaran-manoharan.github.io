[{"title":"autocutsel","description":"As most of you probably know, X has several different mechanisms for copy-paste, used by different applications in different ways. I know some people who use them deliberately, juggling two pieces of text in different clipboards at once, but for me, it&rsquo;s always just been annoying. When I copy something, be it by Gnome C-c, emacs C-w, or selecting it in an xterm, I then want to be able to paste it again, no matter what mechanism I use.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/09/autocutsel/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
