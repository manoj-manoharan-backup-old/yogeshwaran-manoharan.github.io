[{"title":"Binary debugging with git bisect","description":"Part of resolving a bug is finding where and when that bug was introduced into your code. Not so much for blaming a specific person, but more for an understanding of how and maybe why the bug was introduced; and more over which versions of your app are affected.\nMost of the time the bug was recently introduced and your CI notified you that stuff has been broken.\nIn order to find out when, how and by whom the build was broken, you&rsquo;ll have to dig into your git history and run your specs to see if they pass or not.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/11/29/binary-debugging-with-git-bisect/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
