[{"title":"BlueprintCSS Rails Generator","description":"This plugin is no longer available. Blueprint nowadays ships with a very good &lsquo;compress&rsquo; script that allows you to generate all kinds of nice BluePrint layouts. Having a plugin to just copy some files seems a bit excessive. \nI think that, if you&rsquo;re a web developer, you&rsquo;ve seen the BlueprintCSS framework. BlueprintCSS offers quite a bit of CSS code that allows you to quickly and easily build a grid-based layout, using pure CSS.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/27/blueprintcss-rails-generator/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
