[{"title":"Using SQLite In A NativeScript Angular Mobile App","description":"\n                    <p>Quite a bit of time ago when I first started using NativeScript, I wrote a tutorial around <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/04/use-sqlite-save-data-telerik-nativescript-app/\">using a SQLite database</a> with it. Now just to be clear, this was with vanilla NativeScript, before Angular was available. Heck, the previous article was using JavaScript and not even TypeScript.</p>\n<p>Well, times have changed and I figured it would be a good idea to revisit this <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a> SQLite tutorial, but this time give it some TypeScript and Angular flair.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/10/using-sqlite-in-a-nativescript-angular-2-mobile-app/'>Using SQLite In A NativeScript Angular Mobile App</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                  ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/10/using-sqlite-in-a-nativescript-angular-2-mobile-app/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
