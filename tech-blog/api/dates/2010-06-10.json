[{"title":"Cherry-Picking specific commits from another branch","description":"I&rsquo;m often asked how to merge only specific commits from another branch into the current one. The reason you&rsquo;d want to do this is to merge specific changes you need now, leaving other code changes you&rsquo;re not interested in right now behind.\nFirst of all, use git log or the awesome GitX tool to see exactly which commit you want to pick. An example:\ndd2e86 - 946992\t- 9143a9 - a6fd86 - 5a6057 [master] \\ 76cada - 62ecb3\t- b886a0 [feature] Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve written some code in commit 62ecb3 of the feature branch that is very important right now.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2010/06/10/cherry-picking-specific-commits-from-another-branch/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
