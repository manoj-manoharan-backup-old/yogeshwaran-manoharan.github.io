Such things include blog, podcast, and YouTube metrics, as well as information around events and speaking engagements.</p>\n<p>Not only is this an opportunity for me to keep track of things, but you can use it as an opportunity to learn about how I&rsquo;ve conducted business and apply it towards your own.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/12/activity-repor","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/12/activity-report-2019/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
