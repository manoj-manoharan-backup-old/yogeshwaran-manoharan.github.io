Stack Exchange has many REST APIs available, some of which that don&rsquo;t even need tokens or authentication, so it came down to how I wanted to consume this data.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&rsquo;re going to see how to consume question and comment data from the <a href=\"https://api.stackexchange.com/docs\">Stack Exchange API</a> using <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Golang</a> and then export it to comma separated value (CSV) for further evaluation.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/10/analyze-stack-overflow-data-golang-http/'>Analyze Stack Overflow Data With Golang And HTTP</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n  ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/10/analyze-stack-overflow-data-golang-http/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Comparison of APFS file recovery tools","description":"tl;dr\n BlackLight 2018 R3 cannot recover some deleted files on APFS afro is still the only solution to recover the deleted files in the test  APFS is the file system for Apple devices that is used by default on all current iOS mobile devices, as well as macOS since High Sierra, and is thus currently rolled out on a large number of devices. We developed different approaches to identify and recover (deleted) files on an APFS file system and published a paper about the used methodologies.","link":"https://blog.cugu.eu/post/comparison-of-file-recovery-in-apfs/","owner":"Jonas Plum"}]
