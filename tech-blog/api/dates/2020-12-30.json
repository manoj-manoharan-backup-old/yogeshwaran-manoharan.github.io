[{"title":"Continuous Integration for React Native Apps with GitHub Actions","description":"<p>For React Native mobile apps targeting Android and iOS, an easy way to setup its continuous integration is to take advantage of Actions, an automation workflow service provided by GitHub. Even better, for open-source projects, GitHub Action offers unlimited free running minutes (at the time of this writing).</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a> is a single code-base targeting two major mobile platforms, iOS and Android. However, care must be taken so that when one developer focuses on implementing features on fixing defects on Android, whatever they check in into the code will not break iOS and vice versa. Ideally, that developer should always check and verify for both platforms. But mistakes happen and the best way to catch them is to ensure that the corresponding continuous integration (CI) is running smoothly to catch those potential problems early on.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions\">GitHu","link":"https://ariya.io/2020/12/continuous-integration-for-react-native-apps-with-github-actions","owner":"Ariya Hidayat"}]
