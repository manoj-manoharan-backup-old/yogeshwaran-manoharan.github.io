[{"title":"Vim plugin to compile/run code using API","description":"\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/HackerEarth/hackerearth.vim\">https://github.com/HackerEarth/hackerearth.vim</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I love Vim editor. And the idea of a plugin to compile and run code from my favorite\ncode editor sounded exciting. <a href=\"http://developer.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth API</a>\nmade it easier.</p>\n\n<p>Oh man - this is going to be the coolest thing I have ever built.

You have never written a\nplugin before.</p>\n\n<p>There always comes a time when you have to do something for the first time! ;)</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<h4 id=\"where-to-begin\">Where to begin?</h4>\n\n<p>Google is the answer :)\nAfter exploring and reading some tutorials, I found out that VimL, also\nknow as Vim script is the language used to built vim plugins. Here’s the\nbest part. You only need very little knowledge of VimL to be able to write\nplugins, if you know Python (or Ruby).
