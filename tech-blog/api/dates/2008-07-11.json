[{"title":"Photography Heaven","description":"For those who didn&rsquo;t know yet, I&rsquo;m on Flickr - and I just reorganized my entire photo collection.\nBack in the day when I signed up with Flickr, my idea was to store all my photo&rsquo;s there and be done with it. Now, I realize that I only want to upload the good stuff, and keep the rest for myself.\nPlease, hop by at http://flickr.com/photos/ariejan. Feel free to add me to your contacts or to leave a comment.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/07/11/photography-heaven/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
