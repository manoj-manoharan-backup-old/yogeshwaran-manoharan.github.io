It&rsquo;s fast, scalable, and usually quite stable. That isn&rsquo;t a knock against ElasticSearch, but its stability is very dependent on how you setup and configure both the software and your data. This is true for most software, but I find ElasticSearch to be especially temperamental; what ran smoothly for months may all of a sudden start misbehaving, and diagnosing the problem can be time consuming and leave you scratching your head, wondering if solar flares are to blame for your sudden troubles.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, we saw sudden and dramatic spikes in our ElasticSearch open connections. This would happen a couple of times a day, at random intervals. During this time, ElasticSearch would be unable to serve any more requests, negatively impacting our users.
