[{"title":"Sending emails to our half million and growing user community","description":"\n<p>At hackerearth we send emails to keep our users updated on upcoming challenges and\ntheir activities, for example, when a user successfully solves a problem,\nreceives test-invitation, updates on user comments. Basically whenever\nit is appropriate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h3>\n<p>It takes lot of computational power to send emails in such large quantities\nsynchronously. So we have implemented an asynchronous architecture to send emails.</p>\n\n<p>Here is brief overview of the architecture:</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Construct an email and save the serialized email object in database.<br />\nStep 2: Queue the metadata for later consumption.<br />\nStep 3: Consume the metadata, recreate the email object and deliver.</p>\n\n<p>The diagram below shows high level architecture of emailing system. The solid\nline represents the data flow between different components. The dotted line\nrepresents the communications.\nHackerearth email infrastructure consists of MySQL database, MongoDB database,\nRa","link":"http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2016/02/11/sending-emails-to-our-half-million-and-growing-user-community/","owner":"HackerEarth"}]
