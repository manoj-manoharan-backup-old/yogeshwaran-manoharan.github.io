I’ve also done a lot of other performance work on the tools I use, some of which ended up on my other blog, Accidentally Quadratic.\nIn this post, I want to reflect on some of the lessons I’ve learned while writing performant software, and working with rather a lot more not-so-performant software.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"},{"title":"The Sonification of Postmates Data","description":"","link":"https://blog.postmates.com/the-sonification-of-postmates-data-e68294243362?source=rss----2664e1d3cff9--engineering","owner":"Postmates"},{"title":"Troubleshooting systemd with SystemTap","description":"<p>When we set up a schedule on a computer, such as a list of commands to\nrun every day at particular times via Linux <a href=\"https://www.ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs\">cron\njobs</a>, we\nexpect that schedule to execute reliably.
