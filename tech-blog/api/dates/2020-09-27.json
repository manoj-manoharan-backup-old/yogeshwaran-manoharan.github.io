[{"title":"Durability: NVMe disks","description":"<p>Durability is the guarantee that data can be accessed after a failure. It seems like this should be very simple: either your system provides durable data storage, or it does not. However, durability is not a binary yes/no property, and instead should be defined as the <em>kinds</em> of failures you want your data to survive. Since there is usually some performance penalty for durability, many systems provide a way for only &quot;important&quot; writes to be durable, while &quot;normal&quot; writes will eventually be durable, with no specific guarantee about when. Finally, durability is rarely tested, since <em>really</em> testing it involves cutting the power to computer systems, which is disruptive and hard to automate. Production environments are designed to avoid these failures, so bugs are rarely triggered and hard to reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>I've recently been investigating the durability guarantees in cloud platforms. I decided to start at the beginning: what guarantees are provided","link":"https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html","owner":"Evan Jones"}]
