[{"title":"Clear DNS Cache on your router","description":"<p>I currently have a Linksys router at home that has the <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/index.php\">DD-WRT Firmware</a> on it. I&rsquo;ve been using it for quite some time now, and I&rsquo;m very happy with it.</p>\n<p>In my previous post I mentioned there was some trouble with DNS for Ariejan.net. I&rsquo;ve changed nameservers and there&rsquo;s always something that goes wrong.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my router runs DNSMasq, a caching nameserver for my local network. (What this does is, it stores DNS queries and when the same request is made later on, the response is already here (on my network), and my ISP&rsquo;s nameservers don&rsquo;t have to be queried. This makes for a great speed optimalization!)</p>\n<p>The problem was, that my router was caching parts from the old and parts from the new nameservers for Ariejan.net. I could have waited 24-48 hours to let DNSMasq figure it all out by itself, but I&rsquo;m not that patient. What I needed to was reset the cache DNSMasq had built.<","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/07/07/clear-dns-cache-on-your-router/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
