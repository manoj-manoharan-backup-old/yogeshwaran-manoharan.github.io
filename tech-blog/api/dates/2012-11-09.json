This might cause some backwards compatibility issues, so I&rsquo;ve also included a new public method available to all XHP elements called <code>forceAttribute()</code>. The method allows you to set attributes on an element and skip validation checks. I&rsquo;ve also checked in a few fixes and changes to conform to the new strict standards of PHP 5.4. Please let me know if you find any issues.</p>\n<p>You can download the latest XHP sourceÂ <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/xhp\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>","link":"https://codebeforethehorse.tumblr.com/post/35320693712","owner":"Stefan Parker"}]
