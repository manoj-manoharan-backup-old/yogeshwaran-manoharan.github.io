[{"title":"Write Your Go Programs Using GEdit","description":"This is a guest post from Tad Vizbaras from&nbsp;Etasoft&nbsp;in South Florida. There are a number of editors and IDEs for Go development. LiteIde, Vim, Emacs and GEdit just to name a few. Each developer has their own favorite editor for each language they work with. Some like full featured IDE environments while others prefer speed over features. My personal&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;editors for Go development at the moment are Vim and GEdit.\nGEdit comes as part of many Linux distros.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/11/write-your-go-programs-using-gedit.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
