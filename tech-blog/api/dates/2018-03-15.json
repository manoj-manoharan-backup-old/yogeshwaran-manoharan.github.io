[{"title":"Geo-Partitioning: What Global Data Actually Looks Like","description":"As we&#x2019;ve written about previously, geographically distributed databases like CockroachDB offer a number of benefits including reliability, security, and cost-effective deployments. You shouldn&#x2019;t have to sacrifice these upsides to realize impressive throughput and low latencies.\nDistribution, by definition, creates some latency as data must travel from one node to another. We built CockroachDB to make it easy to minimize the latency created in geo-distributed clusters. We can minimize latency by minimizing the distance between where SQL queries are issued and where the data to satisfy those queries resides.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/geo-partitioning-one/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
