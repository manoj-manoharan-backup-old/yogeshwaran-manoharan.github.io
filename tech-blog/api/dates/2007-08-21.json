[{"title":"Using Iconv to convert UTF-8 to ASCII (on Linux)","description":"There are situations where you want to remove all the UTF-8 goodness from a string (mostly because of legacy systems you&rsquo;re working with). Now, this is rather easy to do. I&rsquo;ll give you an example: çéß\nShould be converted to cess. On my mac, I can simply use the following snippet to convert the string:\ns = &#34;çéß&#34; s = Iconv.iconv(&#39;ascii//translit&#39;, &#39;utf-8&#39;, s).to_s # returns &#34;c&#39;ess&#34; s.gsub(/\\W/, &#39;&#39;) # return &#34;cess&#34; Very nice and all, but when I deploy to my Debian 4.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/08/21/using-iconv-to-convert-utf-8-to-ascii-on-linux/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
