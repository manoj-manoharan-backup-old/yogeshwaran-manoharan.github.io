[{"title":"Berlin Geekettes All-Women Hackathon Roundup","description":"Late last year, six women crowded in to a Mitte cafe booth and\nlistened to Berlin Geekettes founder Jess Erickson share her idea:\nBerlin’s first all-women hackathon. With SoundCloud’s Amelie Anglade\nthe then newly-appointed the Berlin Geekettes Tech Ambassador, we\nagreed that it was a great idea to produce the hackathon as a\npartnership between the Geekettes and the women developers of\nSoundCloud.  Fast forward to the first weekend of March, when the vision became\nreality: after 24 hours of hacking, 80 women demoed 29 projects across\na range of different platforms, from a belt transformed into a game\ncontroller to an app aimed to help toddlers learn to do everyday\ntasks.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/berlin-geekettes-hackathon-roundup","owner":"Soundcloud"}]
