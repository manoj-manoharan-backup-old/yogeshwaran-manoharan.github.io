[{"title":"Create A Raspberry Pi Automatic Network Backup Server","description":"\n                    <p>I have a few Raspberry Pi units that I’ve picked up over the years. As of now I have a RPi 256MB, RPi 512MB and a RPi2 1024MB unit. I’m currently using the faster model as a RetroPie which I’ll discuss in a future article, but for the older models I have them doing server stuff. For example, I have my 256MB model acting as a network backup server that one of my computers automatically uploads to.</p>\n<p>Here we’re going to look at what it takes to get an automated backup server rolling with a Raspberry Pi and how exactly it can be useful to you.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/02/create-raspberry-pi-automatic-network-backup-server/'>Create A Raspberry Pi Automatic Network Backup Server</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/02/create-raspberry-pi-automatic-network-backup-server/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
