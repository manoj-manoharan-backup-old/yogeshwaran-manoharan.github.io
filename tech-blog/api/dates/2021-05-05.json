I’ve been at Doximity full time for a little over 3 years and before that, I also was with Doximity for my college internship for 4 months as well.  In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities like surfing, hiking, and snowboarding. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong></p>\n\n<p>How has it been growing at Doximity and seeing the company evolve over the years?  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Wendy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s amazing to see how Doximity has changed, especially the data team.  Since I have joined, we have grown from around 10 people to now over 75 and we continue to grow every day.  Also, seeing our infrastructure be built up has been very impressive.
