[{"title":"On git and usability","description":"I&rsquo;ve been helping a number of people get started working with git over the last couple of weeks, as Ksplice has brought on some new interns, and we&rsquo;ve had to get them up to speed on our internal git repositories. (As you might expect from a bunch of kernel hackers, we use git for absolutely everything). While that experience is what prompted this post, it wasn&rsquo;t really anything I haven&rsquo;t seen before as SIPB transitioned from a group that mostly versioned code in SVN or SVK to one that used git almost exclusively, practically overnight, as these things go.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/01/on-git-and-usability/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
