[{"title":"Create A Full Stack App Using Node.js & Couchbase Server","description":"\n                    <p>Previously I wrote about how to <a href=\"https://blog.couchbase.com/sync-with-couchbase-using-only-angularjs-and-pouchdb\">create an AngularJS application with PouchDB and Couchbase</a>. The way I demonstrated is of course one way to accomplish the job of using Couchbase in a web application. This time around we’re going to take a look at creating a full stack application using the <a href=\"https://www.couchbase.com/\">Couchbase</a>, <a href=\"http://www.expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a>, <a href=\"http://www.angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> (CEAN) stack.</p>\n<p>You might be familiar with the MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js (MEAN) stack, but I’m going to show you that this is just as possible with Couchbase and even easier to do.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to install and configure all four of the CEAN stack services as well as make a very simple application out of them.</p>\n                    \n             ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/10/create-a-full-stack-app-using-node-js-couchbase-server/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"The story of the guy who sold his startup to Box in 7 months","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/unexpected-token/the-story-of-the-guy-who-sold-his-startup-to-box-in-7-months-458739894945?source=rss----2d2624499d2---4","owner":"eFounders"}]
