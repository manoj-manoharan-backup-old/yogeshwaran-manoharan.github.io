[{"title":"reptyr: Changing a process's controlling terminal","description":"reptyr (announced recently on this blog) takes a process that is currently running in one terminal, and transplants it to a new terminal. reptyr comes from a proud family of similar hacks, and works in the same basic way: We use ptrace(2) to attach to a target process and force it to execute code of our own choosing, in order to open the new terminal, and dup2(2) it over stdout and stderr.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/02/changing-ctty/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
