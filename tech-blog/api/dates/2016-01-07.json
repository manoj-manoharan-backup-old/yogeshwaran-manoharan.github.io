We see a healthy split in our user base\nbetween those that just trim down their favorite OS to run containers\nand those that jump onto one of the new container-only operating\nsystems, specifically CoreOS and RancherOS. My\n<a href=\"http://eng.rightscale.com/2015/12/21/using-rightlink-with-docker.html\">previous blog post</a>\ndescribes how the RightScale RightLink agent can be used on traditional Linux distros\nto inventory containers and perform container-level monitoring as well as\napplication-level monitoring of apps in containers. But what if youâ€™re\nusing CoreOS or RancherOS?</p>\n\n<p>In CoreOS there are actually two options: running RightLink at the host\nlevel and running it in a container. It is not obvious which is better\nand, in fact, it really depends on what your goals are.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-images/tve","link":"http://eng.rightscale.com/2016/01/07/running-rightlink-on-coreos.html","owner":"Rightscale"}]
