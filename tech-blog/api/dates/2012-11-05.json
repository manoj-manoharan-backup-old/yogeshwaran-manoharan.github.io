[{"title":"A Call to all CI Service Providers","description":"As a professional developer I test my code. Every check-in I do is tested either on Kabisa&rsquo;s Jenkins server or on Travis CI Pro.\nFor open source projects there&rsquo;s Travis CI. It&rsquo;s free and a great way to get to know Travis.\nNow, as an individual I have some side projects, most notably my own site, Ariejan.net. I value well written and well tested code as much for my own stuff as for my professional work.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/11/05/a-call-to-all-ci-service-providers/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
