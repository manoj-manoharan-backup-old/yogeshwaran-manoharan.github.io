[{"title":"Gradle Remote Build Cache Misses","description":"Until recently, one of the top technical risks facing SoundCloud’s Android team was increasing build times. Our engineering leadership was well aware of the problem, and it was highlighted in our company’s quarterly goals and objectives as modularization. Faster build times means more productive developers. More productive developers are happier and can iterate on products more quickly. Modularization is key to decreasing build times, but avoiding work is another important part of the puzzle, and build caching is one way to avoid that work. Gradle, our tool for building Android, has a local file system cache that reuses outputs of previously performed tasks. We have been using the Gradle remote build cache in order to save our developers’ time. It helps us avoid redoing work that other teammates have already done or switching to old branches. However, to get the full benefits of caching, you have to go beyond simply setting it up.","link":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/gradle-remote-build-cache-misses","owner":"Soundcloud"},{"title":"What the interns have wrought, 2019 edition","description":"<p>Jane Street’s intern program yet again is coming to an end, which is a\nnice opportunity to look back over the summer and see what they’ve\naccomplished.</p>\n\n","link":"https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2019/","owner":"Jane Street"}]
