[{"title":"JRuby with Nick Sieger","description":"A tutorial on JRuby with Nick Sieger holding your hand is just great. This guy knows JRuby inside-out and he has an answer to even the most difficult of questions.\nAfter a short 15 minute introduction, Nick left us with our Rails app to start it with JRuby on a mongrel. I&rsquo;ve been toying around with JRuby a bit before, and this was rather easy. Some people, however, encounter some issues with their apps because of incompatible gems, like OpenSSL or RMagic which are not available for the Java platform.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/09/02/jruby-with-nick-sieger/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"},{"title":"RailsConfEurope: The first tutorial","description":"Today, RailsConfEurope 2008 started! Well, at least if you signed up for Tutorial Day.\nThe first tutorial I&rsquo;m attending is about Hacking Rails Internals. At first I thought about this as a great way to enhance my own apps and be able to easily integrate other apps like Radiant or Mephisto. However, the more I saw of the demo (it really is more a demo than a tutorial really), the more I disliked hacking Rails Internals.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/09/02/railsconfeurope-the-first-tutorial/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
