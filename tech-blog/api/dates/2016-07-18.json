I created my own <a href=\"https://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/embed-couchbase-in-an-iot-project-for-data-synchronization\">Internet of Things (IoT) iBeacon project</a> as well as an <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/09/support-ibeacons-in-your-ionic-framework-mobile-app/\">AngularJS wrapper for using iBeacons</a> in an Ionic Framework application. This time around I figured I’d take my iBeacon adventure to the next level and try to use them in a native Android mobile application.</p>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"http://altbeacon.org/\">AltBeacon</a> library by Radius Networks we can easily add iBeacon monitoring and ranging support to our native Android application.
