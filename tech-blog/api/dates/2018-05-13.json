[{"title":"Structured Logging in Golang","description":"Out of the box, golang provides the stdlib/log package. It provides “printf” style logging. A template string is used along with a list of arguments, and a log message is generated:\nlog.Printf(&#34;user %d wasn&#39;t found&#34;, 1234) // user 1234 wasn&#39;t found This dynamically generated message is easy and convenient but has a number of issues involving storage, searching, and consistency.\nStructured logging solves these problems by replacing the printf message template with named-fields.","link":"https://www.client9.com/structured-logging-in-golang/","owner":"Nick Galbreath"}]
