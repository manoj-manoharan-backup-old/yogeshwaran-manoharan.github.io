[{"title":"Introducing gobpf - Using eBPF from Go","description":"What is eBPF? eBPF is a &ldquo;bytecode virtual machine&rdquo; in the Linux kernel that is used for tracing kernel functions, networking, performance analysis and more. Its roots lay in the Berkeley Packet Filter (sometimes called LSF, Linux Socket Filtering), but as it supports more operations (e.g. BPF_CALL 0x80 /* eBPF only: function call */) and nowadays has much broader use than packet filtering on a socket, it&rsquo;s called extended BPF.","link":"/blog/2016/11/introducing-gobpf-using-ebpf-from-go/","owner":"Kinvolk"},{"title":"LendingHome Featured in the 2017 Wealthfront Career-Launching Companies List","description":"","link":"https://tech.lendinghome.com/lendinghome-featured-in-the-2017-wealthfront-career-launching-companies-list-2a05ed158729?source=rss----68f0e2ba19fc---4","owner":"LendingHome"},{"title":"Roaches on Open Water! CockroachDB on DigitalOcean","description":"If you&#x2019;re a fan of DigitalOcean and its powerful but simple platform to deploy cloud-based infrastructure, you&#x2019;ll appreciate CockroachDB: it&#x2019;s similarly simple to deploy and provides your stack a lot of power and flexibility. And while CockroachDB can be deployed anywhere, it&#x2019;s a natural fit within DigitalOcean&#x2019;s no-fuss framework: both are for developers who like easy-to-reason-about technology that lets them get work done quickly.\nCheck out our office mascot Carl, who looks adorable in a costume clearly inspired by DigitalOcean&#x2019;s Sammy the Shark.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/roaches-on-open-water-cockroachdb-on-digitalocean/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
