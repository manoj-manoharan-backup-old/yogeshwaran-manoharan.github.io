They are an alternative to (and predate) Linux cgroups, Solaris zones, and other OS-level process isolation technologies (the technologies that underlie Docker, CoreOS and a few others) .\nThis blog post will explain how to natively run CockroachDB in a FreeBSD jail. This is lighter weight and as secure as running Docker on FreeBSD.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/critters-in-a-jar-running-cockroachdb-in-a-freebsd-jail/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"Infinite Scrolling in Ruby on Rails","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/wolox/infinite-scrolling-ruby-on-rails-3fcd3bac0f75?source=rss-1e651835442c------2","owner":"Wolox"},{"title":"Why we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack","description":"","link":"https://idea.popcount.org/2016-07-07-why-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack","owner":"Marek Majkowski"}]
