However, because\nof the complexity of its underlying technology and a large number of\nconfigurable parameters, a good configuration is sometimes hard to obtain.

While unrelated, these two topics come up quite a bit, more frequently when I&rsquo;m dealing with person information or lead data that I retrieve from conferences and other events.</p>\n<p>The great thing is that we live in a time where plenty of development libraries and services exist to make this process of data parsing and manipulation easy to accomplish in an automated fashion.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to see how to take a CSV file representing partially complete people data and convert it to JSON.
