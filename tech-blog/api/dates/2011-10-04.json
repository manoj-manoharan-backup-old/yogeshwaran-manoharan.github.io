[{"title":"Image Spriting in XHP","description":"<p>I want to share with you a quick XHP class you can build that will greatly abstract your image spriting. Image sprites are a great way to reduce the number of resources downloaded from your server, but they can be a hassle to maintain. If you already sprite your images then you might have a class that generates the styles for your images. Your API might look something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><code>ImageSprite::getSpriteHtml(ImageSprite::ICON_PHOTOS);</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can sprinkle those into your rendering and it&rsquo;ll work just fine, but with XHP you can build a custom component that behaves more like an HTML <code>img</code> tag than a PHP class and generates your spriting code behind the scenes.<!-- more --></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider the follow XHP element:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><code>class :ui:sprite extends :x:element {<br/>  attribute :img;<br/>  attribute bool usesprite = true;<br/><br/>  private static $_spriteMap = arr","link":"https://codebeforethehorse.tumblr.com/post/11022211307","owner":"Stefan Parker"}]
