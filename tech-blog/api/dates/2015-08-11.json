Self-organized teams work on an idea to solve a problem and show others why their idea is awesome. That&rsquo;s the basic gist of it. When new people join Wattpad, a feedback I often get is how much they enjoy the experience and how much they look forward to it next month. Outsiders are often curious to know how it works and why we seemingly commit hundreds of hours each month to do things not directly related to our goals.
