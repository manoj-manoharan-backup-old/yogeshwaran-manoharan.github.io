[{"title":"Take A Node.js With Express API Serverless Using AWS Lambda","description":"\n                    <p>Not too long ago I had written about creating an API with Node.js and Express that accepted image uploads and manipulated the images to be Android compliant before returning them in a ZIP archive. This article was titled, <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/12/android-launcher-icon-generator-nodejs-jimp\">Create an Android Launcher Icon Generator RESTful API with Node.js, and Jimp</a>, and it was a great example of creating APIs that that did most of their work in memory. I even demonstrated how to <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/12/containerizing-nodejs-express-image-processing-restful-api-docker/\">containerize the application with Docker</a>.</p>\n<p>Applications that manipulate media will need to be able to scale, otherwise there is a risk of the application crashing from not enough resources, or too many resources can get expensive. For this reason, it makes perfect sense to take the previous example serverless with Amazon&rsq","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/12/take-nodejs-express-api-serverless-aws-lambda/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
