[{"title":"Create A Simple RESTful API With Golang","description":"\n                    <p>Most modern applications have separation between the backend and the frontend layers. The backend is typically a RESTful API and is critical part of full stack development. These APIs are generally further broken down into a collection of routes, often referred to as endpoints. Building applications like this is often very clean and maintainable in comparison to mashing everything into a single application.</p>\n<p>I have been creating RESTful APIs with a variety of programming languages, for example <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/10/create-a-simple-restful-api-with-node-js/\">Node.js</a> and Java, but lately I’ve been doing a lot of research on the <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go</a> programming language. It is fast and very solid programming language that every seems to be talking about. Because of this it only made sense to see what it took to build a RESTful API with Go, often referred to as Golang.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see what it takes ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/07/create-a-simple-restful-api-with-golang/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Template folder sharing, reminders dashboard, and custom presets","description":"<p>Today, we’re excited to announce 3 powerful, new accelerators for you and your team.</p><p class=\"poet-read-more\"><a href=\"/blog/template-folder-sharing-and-more\" title=\"Read more of Template folder sharing, reminders dashboard, and custom presets\">Continue reading</a></p>","link":"https://mixmax.com/blog/template-folder-sharing-and-more","owner":"Mixmax"}]
