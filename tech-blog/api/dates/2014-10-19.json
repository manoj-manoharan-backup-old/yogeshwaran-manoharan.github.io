[{"title":"Implement AES Strength Encryption With JavaScript","description":"\n                    <p>I recently started playing around with the Dropbox Datastore JavaScript API and decided that I wanted an extra layer of security in the data I store on the Dropbox server. I figured the best way to accomplish this would be to encrypt all data in my application before syncing.</p>\n<p>It took me a while to find an encryption library that I liked, but in the end, I chose the JavaScript library <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge\">Forge</a>. This library has plenty of cryptography tools that extend beyond just AES encryption, thus making it very worthy to check out.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/10/implement-aes-strength-encryption-javascript/'>Implement AES Strength Encryption With JavaScript</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/10/implement-aes-strength-encryption-javascript/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
