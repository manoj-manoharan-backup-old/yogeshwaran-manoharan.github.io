[{"title":"Why Control Flows Should NOT Be In XHP","description":"<p>About every six to nine months or so, an engineer at Facebook tries to add a control structure into XHP. These usually come in up to four flavors per diff: <code>&lt;x:if&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;x:switch&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;x:for&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;x:foreach&gt;</code> (and occasionally <code>&lt;x:map&gt;</code>, which really is just a different <code>&lt;x:foreach&gt;</code>). A diff is submitted and invariably a long discussion ensues before the diff is eventually abandoned. I have to admit, it is tempting sometimes. I mean, we can keep everything in a single XHP block. How much cleaner is that?<!-- more --></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>$panel = userIsAdmin()<br/>  ? &lt;ui:admin-panel /&gt;<br/>  : &lt;ui:user-panel /&gt;;<br/>$root = &lt;div&gt;{$panel}&lt;/div&gt;;</code></p>\n<p><code>$root =<br/>  &lt;div&gt;<br/>    &lt;x:if cond={userIsAdmin()}&gt;<br/>      &lt;ui:admin-panel /&gt;<br/>      &lt;ui:user-panel /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/x:if&gt;<br/>  &lt;/div&gt;;</code></p>\n<","link":"https://codebeforethehorse.tumblr.com/post/36089777404","owner":"Stefan Parker"}]
