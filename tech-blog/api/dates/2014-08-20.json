[{"title":"New reptyr feature: TTY-stealing","description":"Ever since I wrote reptyr, I&rsquo;ve been frustrated by a number of issues in reptyr that I fundamentally didn&rsquo;t know how to solve within the reptyr model. Most annoyingly, reptyr fundamentally only worked on single processes, and could not attach processes with children, making it useless in a large class of real-world situations.\nTTY stealing Recently, I merged an experimental reptyr feature that I call &ldquo;tty-stealing&rdquo;, which has the potential to fix all of these issues (with some other disadvantages, which I&rsquo;ll discuss later).","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2014/08/new-reptyr-feature-tty-stealing/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
