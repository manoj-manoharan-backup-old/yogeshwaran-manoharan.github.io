Because systemd is the first process started on boot, the traditional way to test was to install the new version on your own computer and reboot. However, this approach is not practical because it makes the development cycle quite long: after writing a few lines of code, I don’t want to close all my applications and reboot. There is also a risk that my patch contains some bugs and if I install systemd on my development computer, it won’t boot.","link":"/blog/2015/12/testing-systemd-patches/","owner":"Kinvolk"},{"title":"The Cost and Complexity of Cgo","description":"Cgo is a pretty important part of Go: It&#x2019;s your window to calling anything that isn&#x2019;t Go (or, more precisely, anything that has C bindings).\nFor CockroachDB, cgo lets us delegate a lot of the heavy lifting at the storage layer to RocksDB, for which no suitable replacement within the Go ecosystem exists, at least to the best of our knowledge. After some iterations, we&#x2019;ve found that the right way to deal with these external libraries &#x2013; of which we have quite a few &#x2013; is to outsource them in Go wrapper packages:","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/the-cost-and-complexity-of-cgo/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
