[{"title":"Connect To Multiple Wireless Networks With A Raspberry Pi","description":"\n                    <p>So I recently picked up some more <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> 3 units. You’re probably thinking I’m building my own T1000 (Terminator reference) with these things. No, actually I got these units for work to play around with some IoT projects around the office at <a href=\"https://www.couchbase.com/\">Couchbase</a>. I have a few offices that I visit at Couchbase which brought up my need to have multiple possible wireless networks to connect to as I travel. These are <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/02/use-your-raspberry-pi-as-a-headless-system-without-a-monitor/\">headless units</a> so I’m not connecting to them with a mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>Now one would imagine that I can just add a bunch of networks to a configuration file in Linux, but that wasn’t the case. There are special configurations that must be done to allow the Raspberry Pi to automatically connect to different wireless networks as they become available.","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/connect-multiple-wireless-networks-raspberry-pi/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Removal of Groups endpoints","description":"As well as adding new features and updates, we review existing features to see if they’re still beneficial to the community.
