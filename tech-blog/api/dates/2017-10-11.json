[{"title":"Alias URLS In Hugo Websites Using RewriteRule For Htaccess","description":"\n                    <p>As you may remember, I recently released <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/09/polyglot-developer-new-look-v2/\">The Polyglot Developer 2.0</a> which was a migration from WordPress to Hugo. Because my WordPress permalinks matched a similar format to Hugo I didn&rsquo;t have to make too many changes. However, there was an issue with the <code>category</code> and <code>tag</code> taxonomies. In Hugo these were recommended to be plural, while in WordPress they were singular.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m currently using Apache for hosting The Polyglot Developer so I had to figure out how to redirect the previous WordPress traffic to prevent bad links which would hurt the search engine optimization (SEO) of my blog. We&rsquo;re going to see how I made such redirects happen.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/10/alias-hugo-url-htaccess-rewriterule/'>Alias URLS In Hugo Websit","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/10/alias-hugo-url-htaccess-rewriterule/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Live Video Transmuxing/Transcoding: FFmpeg vs TwitchTranscoder, Part I","description":"","link":"https://medium.com/twitch-news/live-video-transmuxing-transcoding-ffmpeg-vs-twitchtranscoder-part-i-489c1c125f28?source=rss----3ae745429979--engineering","owner":"Twitch"}]
