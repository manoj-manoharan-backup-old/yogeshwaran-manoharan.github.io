[{"title":"Tracy Developer Meetup in California","description":"\n                    <p>After having thought about it for quite some time, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to start a developer user group in my home town of Tracy, California. This group titled, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/tracydevs/\">The Tracy Developer Meetup</a>, was started to give developers living outside of the Bay Area, a chance to collaborate with other developers in the same position.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Tracy, it is a town about 1.5 hours from San Francisco and Mountain View, but significantly more affordable and home to many engineers that commute to the Bay Area for work.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/tracy-developer-meetup-california/'>Tracy Developer Meetup in California</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/tracy-developer-meetup-california/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
