[{"title":"FlameScope Pattern Recognition","description":"Flamescope is a new open source performance visualization tool that uses subsecond offset heat maps and flame graphs to analyze periodic activity, variance, and perturbations. We posted this on the Netflix TechBlog, Netflix FlameScope, and the tool is on github. While flame graphs are well understood, subsecond offset heat maps are not (they are another visualization I invented a while ago). FlameScope should help adoption.\n","link":"http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2018-11-08/flamescope-pattern-recognition.html","owner":"Brendan Gregg"},{"title":"How To Build Reusable Angular Components And Share Them With The World","description":"\n                    <p>As you probably know, Angular is all about building UI components. There are several excellent component libraries out there that you can use to build your own application, such as <a href=\"https://material.angular.io/\">Angular Material</a>, <a href=\"https://vmware.github.io/clarity/\">Clarity</a> or <a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui\">Kendo UI</a> to name a few.</p>\n<p>Such libraries provide common reusable components such as tabs, date pickers, collapsible menus, and much more. Still, there&rsquo;s always a time where we need something more customized and more adapted to the specific needs of our project.</p>\n<p>If you ever get in that spot where you want to create a component that might be reused in different projects, or if you want to write components that you would then open-source, this article is for you.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/how-build-reusa","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/11/how-build-reusable-angular-components-share-world/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
