[{"title":"Introducing PSync","description":"<p>Here on the Android team at Flipboard, we have a lot of settings for users to adjust their experience. If you throw in internal settings, we have about 100 total preferences to manage. This is <em>a lot</em> of boilerplate to maintain, because preferences in Android have no built-in synchronization (unlike Resources). Our <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><table class=\"rouge-table\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"rouge-gutter gl\"><pre class=\"lineno\">1\n</pre></td><td class=\"rouge-code\"><pre>PreferenceFragment</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code> class has a couple hundred lines of boilerplate fields at the top where we keep in-code mirrors to these preference values. This design is tedious, brittle, and requires a lot of overhead to keep in sync with XML. We developed a Gradle plugin called PSync to solve this problem.\n<!--break--></p>\n\n<p>PSync is an Android-specific Gradle plugin that generates Java representations of XML preferences. These Java classes can then be used directly in your code","link":"http://engineering.flipboard.com//2015/09/psync","owner":"Flipboard"},{"title":"Valley Riff Podcast - Andrew Chapin on Starting Up in Hawaii and Choosing Investors","description":"<figure class=\"avatar--circle  text-center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/valley-riff/andrew_chapin.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Chapin\">\n<p><i>Andrew Chapin, Co-Founder and CEO at benjamin</i></p>\n</figure>\n\n<p class=\"poet-read-more\"><a href=\"/blog/benjamin-founder-on-hawaii-and-investors\" title=\"Read more of Valley Riff Podcast - Andrew Chapin on Starting Up in Hawaii and Choosing Investors\">Continue reading</a></p>","link":"https://mixmax.com/blog/benjamin-founder-on-hawaii-and-investors","owner":"Mixmax"}]
