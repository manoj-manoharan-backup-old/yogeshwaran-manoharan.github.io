[{"title":"CUPS: 426 - Upgrade Required","description":"As I was installing my printer on my Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper LTS server with CUPS I noticed the following error:\n 426 Upgrade Required\n After some research I came to the conclusion that CUPS, by default, tries to use SSL whenever possible. So, with this 426 error, you are redirected to the SSL domain. Chances are, you haven&rsquo;t configured SSL properly, if at all.\nIn my case, I didn&rsquo;t want to configure SSL.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/11/13/cups-426-upgrade-required/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
