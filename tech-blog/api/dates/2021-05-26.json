The basic idea, which was proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf\">WiscKey paper</a>, is key-value separation: by storing large values in dedicated blob files and storing only small pointers to them in the LSM tree, we avoid copying the values over and over again during compaction, thus reducing write amplification. Historically, BlobDB supported only FIFO and TTL based use cases that can tolerate some data loss. In addition, it was incompatible with many widely used RocksDB features, and required users to adopt a custom API. In 2020, we decided to rearchitect BlobDB from the ground up, taking the lessons learned from WiscKey and the original BlobDB but also drawing inspiration and incorporating ideas from other similar systems.
