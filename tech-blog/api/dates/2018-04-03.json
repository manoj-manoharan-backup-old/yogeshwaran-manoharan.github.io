However, build systems usually do not realize all of the \r\npossible gains in dynamic incremental rebuilds due to how they handle \r\ntransitive library dependencies. Red Hat's ABI introspection library \r\nlibabigail offers one possible path to eliminating unnecessary transitive \r\nre-linking for some classes of source modifications.","link":"https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/pruning-dynamic-rebuilds-with-libabigail","owner":"MongoDB"},{"title":"Slicker: A Tool for Moving Things in Python","description":"","link":"http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/slicker.htm","owner":"Khan Academy"}]
