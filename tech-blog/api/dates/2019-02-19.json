[{"title":"Randomized trial on gender in Overwatch","description":"\n\n<p>A recurring discussion in Overwatch (as well as other online games) is whether or not women are treated differently from men. If you do a quick search, you can find hundreds of discussions about this, some of which have well over a thousand comments. These discussions tend to go the same way and involve the same debate every time, with the same points being made on both sides. Just for example, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8hvmih/the_girl_problem_an_open_letter_to_the_overwatch/\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8i4wvs/a_response_to_the_girl_problem_post_moral/\">three</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8i7cbx/when_we_call_talking_about_sexism_in_overwatch/\">threads</a> on reddit that spun out of a single post that have a total of 10.4k comments. On one side, you have people saying &quot;sure, women get trash talked, but I'm a dude and I get trash talked, everyone gets trash talked there's no difference&quo","link":"https://danluu.com/overwatch-gender/","owner":"Dan Luu"}]
