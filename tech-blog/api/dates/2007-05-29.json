Today I noticed that setting up the connection takes about 5 to 10 seconds. This is really annoying when editing files through FTP.\nSo, I investigated and found that by default ProFTPD tries to revolve the hostname of the client in order to put that in the logs instead of a plain IP address. This lookup can take quite some time, let&rsquo;s say 5 to 10 seconds, especially when the look up fails and you have to wait on a time-out.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/05/29/slow-connections-with-proftpd/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
