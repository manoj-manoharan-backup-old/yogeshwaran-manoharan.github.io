[{"title":"Upgrade postgresql-8.4 to postgresql-9.1 on debian","description":"Today I upgraded a production PostgreSQL 8.4 database to version 9.1. This was on a Debian server. ~ The first step is to make a full dump of your data. I personally like to store that dump somewhere safe before upgrading. As root:\nsu - postgres pg_dumpall &gt; dump.sql exit cp ~postgres/dump.sql /root/ Now you can safely remove the postgresql-8.4 and install postgresql-9.1:\naptitude purge postgresql-8.4 aptitude install postgresql-9.1 Next check the postgresql configuration in /etc/postgresql/9.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/11/22/upgrade-postgresql-8-4-to-postgresql-9-1-on-debian/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
