[{"title":"MERGE request failed on ‘/path/to/file’","description":"After upgrading my Subversion server to Ubuntu Feisty, I noticed that when committing I got the following error:\nsvn: MERGE request failed on '/svn/repository/trunk' svn: MERGE of '/svn/repository/trunk': 200 OK (http://svn.myserver.com) Although the messages says that the commit failed, it has not. A simple &lsquo;svn update&rsquo; will merge the changes you made to the repository to your working copy again and you&rsquo;re good to go.\nSo, what is the problem here?","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2007/05/21/merge-request-failed-on-pathtofile/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
