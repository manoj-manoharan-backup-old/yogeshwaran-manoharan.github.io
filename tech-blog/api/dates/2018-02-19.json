[{"title":"Encrypt And Decrypt Data In A Golang Application With The Crypto Packages","description":"\n                    <p>Being able to encrypt and decrypt data within an application is very useful for a lot of circumstances. Let&rsquo;s not confuse encryption and decryption with hashing like that found in a bcrypt library, where a hash is only meant to transform data in one direction.</p>\n<p>Not too long ago I wrote about in a <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/01/encrypt-decrypt-data-nodejs-crypto-library/\">previous article</a> how to encrypt and decrypt data using Node.js. This was partially inspired by me learning how to build software wallets for cryptocurrencies and encrypting the sensitive information. However, what if we wanted to use Go instead of Node.js?</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to take a look at encrypting data and then decrypting it within a Go application by using the already available crypto packages.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/encrypt-decrypt-data-g","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/encrypt-decrypt-data-golang-application-crypto-packages/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
