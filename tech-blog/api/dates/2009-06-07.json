[{"title":"ActiveRecord: Skipping callbacks like after_save or after_update","description":"Active Records provides callbacks, which is great is you want to perform extra business logic after (or before) saving, creating or destroying an instance of that model.\nHowever, there are situations where you can easily fall into the trap of creating an infinite loop.\nclass Beer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base def after_save x = some_magic_method(self) update_attribute(:my_attribute, x) end end The above will give you a nice infinite loop (which doesn&rsquo;t scale). It&rsquo;s possible to update your model, without calling the callbacks and without resorting to SQL.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/06/07/activerecord-skipping-callbacks-like-after_save-or-after_update/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"},{"title":"has_one - find all that have no associated object","description":"Let me pose a typical Rails situation:\nclass Person Now, how can you get all the people that don&rsquo;t have a fancy hat?\nclass Person 'LEFT JOIN fancy_hats ON fancy_hats.person_id = people.id', :conditions = 'fancy_hats.person_id IS NULL' end Now you can find all the hatless people you want.\nFYI: Finding fancy hats that have no one to wear them is a lot easier, because the foreign key is stored in the fancy_hats table.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/06/07/has_one-find-all-that-have-no-associated-object/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"},{"title":"IMDB 0.3.0 now including console utility - query IMDB from your console","description":"With the release of IMDB 0.3.0, a command-line utility is included!\nWhy is this awesome for you?
