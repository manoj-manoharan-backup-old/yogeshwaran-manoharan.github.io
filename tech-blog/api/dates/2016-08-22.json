[{"title":"Live Migrate a Mongo Database","description":"<p>Over the weekend we had to migrate a database to another host, and wanted to do it without downtime. We searched for solutions on how to “live” migrate a Mongo database, but everything we found suggested adding the new host to the replicaset to auto-sync, and then have it take over as master.

I had released a Alexa skill called <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/07/bart-control-skill-amazons-alexa-released/\">BART Control</a> and published a guide on creating a <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/create-amazon-alexa-skill-nodejs-aws-lambda/\">simple skill with Node.js and Lambda</a>. If you went through my Node.js and Lambda guide you probably found it pretty painful to test the skill you were working on. The constant building and uploading to Lambda could easily get out of control. What if I told you there was a much simpler way that could save you a ton of time?</p>\n<p>We’re going to take a look at adding test cases for testing an Alexa skill offline without ever having to upload the skill to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">Lambda</a>.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/test-amazon-alexa-skills-offline-with-mocha-and-chai-for-node-js/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
