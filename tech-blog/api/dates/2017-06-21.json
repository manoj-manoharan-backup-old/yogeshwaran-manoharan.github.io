[{"title":"It doesn’t want anything","description":"<p>Tim Cook’s entire <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NXjUpo-1q8\">commencement address</a> to the MIT class of 2017 is an instant classic, but this is the part I want to echo forever:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn’t want to do great things. It doesn’t want anything. That part takes all of us. It takes our values and our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities. Our love of beauty and belief that all of our faiths are interconnected. Our decency. Our kindness.</p>\n\n  <p>I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion, without concern for consequences. That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we’ve been and the danger that lies ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","link":"http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2017/06/21/doesnt-want-anything.html","owner":"Eddie Smith"},{"title":"Liquid Markup","description":"<p>Today, we’re excited to announce a ground-breaking new feature: Liquid Markup.
