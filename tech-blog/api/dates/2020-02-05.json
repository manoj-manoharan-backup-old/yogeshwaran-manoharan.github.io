[{"title":"Test Password Strength with RegEx in a React Application","description":"\n                    <p>While some organizations think it is up to the user to protect themselves by choosing strong usernames and passwords, the developer can help influence good password choices by including it in the design of the application. For example, the developer could include bars, percentages, or colors to help dictate quality of a password as the user enters it into a form.</p>\n<p>A lot of us know a weak password is short and contains either alpha or numeric, but never both. We also know strong passwords include symbols as well as variations of character case-sensitivity. So how can we check for these things in the application?</p>\n<p>In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to make use of regular expressions to test the quality of a password. This is going to be done with simple JavaScript in a React application.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2020/02/test-password-strength-regex-react-ap","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2020/02/test-password-strength-regex-react-application/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Welcome Docs: Getting Started at Cockroach Labs","description":"Welcome, New Roacher!\nThat&#x2019;s how all of our Welcome Documents start, though you can expect yours to start with your name on top.
