[{"title":"Testing Rails 3 scopes revisited","description":"In my previous article I told you about how I like to tests my scope. There was a fair amount of criticism on that post and after considering it all (and hearing Corey Haines' talk on Arrrrcamp last friday), I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s the wrong path.\nIn essence Rails allows you to create a scope to generate a custom database query for you. Now, if you only test your configuration of Rails (as I did in my previous post), you don&rsquo;t know if that scope works or not.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/10/09/testing-rails-3-scopes-revisited/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
