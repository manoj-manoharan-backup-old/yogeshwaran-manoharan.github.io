[{"title":"Scheduler Tracing In Go","description":"Introduction One of the things I love about Go is the profiling and debug information you can generate. There is a special environmental variable named GODEBUG that will emit debugging information about the runtime as your program executes. You can request summary and detailed information for both the garbage collector and the scheduler. Whatâ€™s great is you don&rsquo;t need to build your program with any special switches for it to work.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2015/02/scheduler-tracing-in-go.html","owner":"William Kennedy"}]
