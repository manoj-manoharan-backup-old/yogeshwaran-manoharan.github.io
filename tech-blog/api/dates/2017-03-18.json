By rarely, I don’t mean never, but in most cases I find that I’m building my own custom Docker image for any web application that I wish to containerize. This allows me to create an image that meets my needs and deploy it anywhere and anytime that I find necessary.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see how to build a simple web application and turn it into a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> image so it is containerized and easily deployable anywhere that Docker Engine is available.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/build-custom-docker-image-containerized-web-application/'>Build A Custom Docker Image For Your Containerized Web Application</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyg","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/build-custom-docker-image-containerized-web-application/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
