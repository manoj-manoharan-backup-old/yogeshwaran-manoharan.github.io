[{"title":"Pagerank 3, 19k Hits/Month","description":"I just found out Ariejan.net has a PageRank™ of 3! If you don&rsquo;t know what PageRank™ means, let Google explain:\nPageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page's value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/01/30/pagerank-3-19k-hitsmonth/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
