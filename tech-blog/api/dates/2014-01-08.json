I was pretty happy with <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text 2</a> (and still use it for Ruby/Python/Shell/whatever) but the lack of code completion was really starting to affect my productivity.  I spent way too much time looping through the edit/compile/fix typo cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Before I could switch though, I really wanted my fancy arrows in Scala!
