[{"title":"Capistrano and the custom maintenance page","description":"Randuin posted a comment on my previous Lighting fast, zero-downtime deployments with git, capistrano, nginx and Unicorn post asking how I handle database migrations. This is a good question.\nDatabase migrations, especially with large datasets, take a long time to run. They also lock your database tables which may cause all kinds of trouble.\nThere&rsquo;s a quite an easy solution for this, offered to us by Capistrano. Unfortunately it will cause downtime for your site while the migration is running.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/09/19/capistrano-and-the-custom-maintenance-page/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
