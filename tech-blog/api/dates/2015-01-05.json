[{"title":"Parse An XML Response With Node.js","description":"\n                    <p>A while back I wrote an article on how to <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/09/parse-xml-response-php/\">parse XML using PHP</a>. Since then I’ve slowly been transitioning away from PHP, yet XML continues to be a burden that I can’t get rid of.</p>\n<p>Not all APIs return JSON so it is the application developers responsibility to handle the XML. Lucky for us there is a convenient package for Node.js called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/xml2js\">xml2js</a> that will handle all the parsing for us.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/01/parse-xml-response-nodejs/'>Parse An XML Response With Node.js</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot Developer</a>.</p>\n                    \n                ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/01/parse-xml-response-nodejs/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
