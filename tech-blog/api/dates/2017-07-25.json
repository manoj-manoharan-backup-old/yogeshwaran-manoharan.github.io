[{"title":"A nod to checklists","description":"<p>Gabe whipped up a <a href=\"http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/07/managing-check-lists.html\">great list</a> of checklist tools. My favorite aspect of his post is that there’s no clear winner. There shouldn’t be.</p>\n\n<p>Checklists can come in all forms, and the ideal format depends entirely on the application. For me, checklists make sense when I need to see not only what needs to be done, but also what I’ve <em>already done</em>. Apps that automatically “vanish” completed tasks fail to do the latter.</p>\n\n<p>For me, sometimes there’s just no substitute for a spreadsheet for large checklists, especially if each item can have multiple statuses or dimensions. Sometimes adding more columns is way more efficient than adding more tasks (rows).</p>\n\n<p>For packing lists, I’ve tried so many apps, but <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner\">OmniOutliner</a> is the best for me. It’s simple checkbox feature is perfect, and I have several templates I use for different types of trips.</p>\n\n","link":"http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2017/07/25/checklists.html","owner":"Eddie Smith"},{"title":"AWS Infrastructure Setup: The CleverTap Way","description":null,"link":"https://clevertap.com/blog/aws-infrastructure-setup-the-clevertap-way/","owner":"CleverTap"},{"title":"Introducing springmock","description":"\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using springboot for some time now, but there was that one thing that bugged me a lot.\nWhile writing integration tests with mocks you are forced to use mockito as the mocking library.\nThat&#8217;s great and easy to understand if you are not using spock.
