[{"title":"Time series features extraction using Fourier and Wavelet transforms on ECG data","description":"ABSTRACT This article focuses on the features extraction from time series and signals using Fourier and Wavelet transforms. This task will be carried out on an electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset in order to classify three groups of people: those with cardiac arrhythmia (ARR), congestive heart failure (CHF) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Our approach consists of [â€¦]","link":"https://blog.octo.com/en/time-series-features-extraction-using-fourier-and-wavelet-transforms-on-ecg-data/","owner":"OCTO Technology"}]
