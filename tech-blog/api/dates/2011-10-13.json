[{"title":"Fast specs - Run your specs in less than 1 second","description":"Okay, let me clarify that title first. I, as most of you, have two sets of tests for my Rails application: rspec and cucumber. rspec heavily focusses on testing models and business logic while cucumber focusses on testing the entire application stack and user interaction.\nThe problem is that as your app grows, your test set grows - and so does the time it takes to run those tests.\nThis post is inspired by Corey Haines' talk at Arrrrcamp (Oct 2011) and my own experience with writing fast specs.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2011/10/13/fast-specs-run-your-specs-in-less-than-1-second/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
