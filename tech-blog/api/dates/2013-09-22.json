[{"title":"Isolate Namespace in Rails Engines - A hack in itself","description":"isolate_namespace is that one feature which Rails boasts about to use while creating gems, but doesn&rsquo;t work when one wants to extend models, controllers and views which are provided by that gem. We have used it while developing one of our gems and found that its really hard to extend models, controllers and views. For instance, if you copy views from gem to main application in order to customize them, and try to use routes defined in the main application, you will be slapped with an error saying those routes are not defined!","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-22-isolate-namespace-in-rails-engines/","owner":"Codemancers"}]
