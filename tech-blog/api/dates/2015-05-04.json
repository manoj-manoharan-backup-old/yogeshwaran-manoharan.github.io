[{"title":"Sort An Integer Array Using Bubble Sort With Java","description":"\n                    <p>Previously you saw an implementation of Quicksort, one of the better sorting algorithms. This time we’re going to look at a much inferior sorting algorithm which generally makes its appearance in introduction to computer science type courses. I’m talking about the Bubble Sort algorithm.</p>\n<p>Bubble Sort via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Bubble Sort algorithm is sub-par because of the outrageous time-complexity that it has for all sorting calls and we’re going to see why.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/05/sort-an-integer-array-using-bubble-sort-with-java/'>Sort An Integer ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/05/sort-an-integer-array-using-bubble-sort-with-java/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
