[{"title":"Review: Parking London","description":"This is a paid review\nI&rsquo;ve been asked to review a service named Parking London. What this service does is two things, really. Firstly, it allows owners of garages and parking spaces in London to offer their spots to others. A location can be specified, with a small description. Of course, the price for the monthly tenancy or sale is added.\nThe service doesn&rsquo;t look very special at a first glance.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2008/01/03/review-parking-london/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
