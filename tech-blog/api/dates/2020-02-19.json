[{"title":"Build a Java App with CockroachDB and jOOQ","description":"We&#x2019;re excited to announce that the latest release of jOOQ supports CockroachDB.&#xA0;\njOOQ is a database-mapping software library in Java that lets you take advantage of your database&#x2019;s SQL capabilities while still coding in Java. As of this writing, jOOQ supports over twenty relational database management systems, from PostgreSQL to Oracle. But with most of these options (especially the open source ones) developers are still left to manage database scale and ensure the database is resilient and always on.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/announcing-jooq-support-for-cockroachdb/","owner":"CockroachDB"},{"title":"Our New-Year Pairing Experiment","description":"InVision is a distributed company with a good number of engineering teams.

In our case, somewhere around mid January, my team got the crazy idea in our heads that we might be able to curb feelings of remote isolation by finding more ways to work together instead of alone.","link":"https://engineering.invisionapp.com/post/our-new-year-pairing-experiment/","owner":"InVision"}]
