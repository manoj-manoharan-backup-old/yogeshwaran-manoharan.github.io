[{"title":"Concurrency, Goroutines and GOMAXPROCS","description":"Introduction\nWhen new people join the Go-Miami group they always write that they want to learn more about Go&rsquo;s concurrency model. Concurrency seems to be the big buzz word around the language. It was for me when I first started hearing about Go. It was Rob Pike&rsquo;s Go Concurrency Patterns video that finally convinced me I needed to learn this language.\nTo understand how Go makes writing concurrent programs easier and less prone to errors, we first need to understand what a concurrent program is and the problems that result from such programs.","link":"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/01/concurrency-goroutines-and-gomaxprocs.html","owner":"William Kennedy"},{"title":"Design and Development Process","description":"Remote engagements are hard by their very nature. In a set up where people involved in the project are separated by time and distance, having a well worked out process is the only way to ensure smooth engagement and steady progress. However, process implementation requires a fine balance - There should be enough of it to drive frictionless communication but not so much that adhering to it is in itself hindering progress.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2014-01-29-design-and-development-process/","owner":"Codemancers"}]
