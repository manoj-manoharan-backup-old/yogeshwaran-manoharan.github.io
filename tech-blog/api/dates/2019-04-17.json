You could create a RESTful API or GraphQL API on your server and consume it on-demand with your client, or you can go the socket approach and interact in real-time through events. There isn&rsquo;t a wrong way to do things, but some ways are better than others given the task at hand.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take for example gaming and online multiplayer games. While certain aspects of the game would make sense to use REST or GraphQL, not everything would feel responsive enough. Instead it makes sense to use sockets.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to explore <a href=\"https://socket.io/\">Socket.io</a> for our client and server communication. We&rsquo;re going to create a Socket.io server with Node.js and that server will communicate with each of our games running as <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> applications.</p>\n                    \n  ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/04/using-socketio-create-multiplayer-game-angular-nodejs/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
