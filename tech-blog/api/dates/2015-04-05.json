[{"title":"Parse An XML Response With Java And Dom4J","description":"\n                    <p>Previously we’ve explored how to parse XML data using <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/01/parse-xml-response-nodejs/\">Node.js</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/09/parse-xml-response-php/\">PHP</a>. Continuing on the trend of parsing data using various programming languages, this time we’re going to take a look at parsing XML data using the <a href=\"http://dom4j.sourceforge.net/dom4j-1.6.1/index.html\">dom4j</a> library with Java.</p>\n<p>Now dom4j, is not the only way to parse XML data in Java. There are many other ways including using the SAX parser. Everyone will have their own opinions on which of the many to use.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/04/parse-an-xml-response-with-java-dom4j/'>Parse An XML Response With Java And Dom4J</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Poly","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/04/parse-an-xml-response-with-java-dom4j/","owner":"Nic Raboy"}]
