[{"title":"Happy Monday!","description":"<p>Today I tell you a story about one tricky bug. The bug is a tricky one because it doesn&rsquo;t allow me to debug my application on Mondays. I&rsquo;m serious right now: the debug mode doesn&rsquo;t work every Monday. Furthermore, the bug literally tell me: &ldquo;Happy Monday!&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So, the story. It was a wonderful Sunday evening, no signs of trouble. We planned to release a new version of our software (a minor one, but it includes some useful features). Midnight on the clock. Suddenly, I came up with the idea that we have a minor bug that should be fixed. It requires a few lines of code and 10 minutes to do it. And I decided to write needed logic before I go to sleep. I open VisualStudio, lunch build, and wait. But something goes wrong, because I get the following error:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\">Error connecting to the pipe server.\n</code></pre></div><p>Hmm. It is a strange error.</p>","link":"https://aakinshin.net/posts/happy-monday/","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"},{"title":"Open Sourcing DOM Comparator","description":"DOM Comparator is a JavaScript library that analyzes and compares two HTML strings, and returns back a diff object.
