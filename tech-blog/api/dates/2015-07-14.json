[{"title":"Developing our Apple Watch app","description":"<p>Before developing our Apple Watch app, we had to figure out its purpose. Are we developing it just because it is this “new thing” or can we really provide our users an experience we cannot provide elsewhere. When we put ourselves in our writer&rsquo;s shoes, we saw this obsessive need to check how our own stories are doing. How many people read it? How many people voted for it? We can obviously use our phones to check those numbers but the watch just gave us a way to make that tedious task more pleasant and helpful. Every time the user checks the statistics for one of their stories, we show them the delta in the numbers from the last time they checked it. This idea also applied to the number of followers of the writer. Our designers came up with a beautiful animation to complement this as well.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"386\" data-orig-width=\"310\"><img width=\"310\" height=\"386\" data-orig-height=\"386\" data-orig-width=\"310\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/6019e156c3758734c0f7235fab3","link":"https://engineering.wattpad.com/post/124070487127","owner":"Wattpad"},{"title":"Leveraging AWS API Gateway and Lambda to build a Slack bot","description":"<figure class=\"blue-border\"><img class=\"raised\" src=\"/images/blog/modulus-webhook/slack-message.png\" alt=\"Slack Message\"></figure>\n\n<p>The engineering team at Mixmax loves Slack integrations. Slack&rsquo;s webhook API makes it super easy to integrate external data right into the heart of our internal communications. With just a few clicks we can configure integrations like GitHub pull requests or PagerDuty alerts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"poet-read-more\"><a href=\"/blog/how-to-get-modulusio-webhooks-into-your-slack-channel\" title=\"Read more of Leveraging AWS API Gateway and Lambda to build a Slack bot\">Continue reading</a></p>","link":"https://mixmax.com/blog/how-to-get-modulusio-webhooks-into-your-slack-channel","owner":"Mixmax"}]
