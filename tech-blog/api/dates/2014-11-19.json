[{"title":"Are Your Cache-Control Directives Doing What They Are Supposed to Do?","description":"<p>HTTP offers very powerful support for <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-13\">caching</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need to send requests in many cases,\nand to eliminate the need to send full responses in many other cases. The former reduces the\nnumber of network round-trips required for many operations; we use an &quot;expiration&quot; mechanism\nfor this purpose (see section 13.2). The latter reduces network bandwidth requirements; we\nuse a &quot;validation&quot; mechanism for this purpose (see section 13.3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with how the &quot;expiration&quot; and &quot;validation&quot; mechanisms work in different\nkinds of HTTP caches, you should start with <a href=\"http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do\">Things Caches Do</a>\nby Ryan Tomayko.
