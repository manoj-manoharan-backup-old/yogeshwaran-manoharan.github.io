[{"title":"Convert strftime Time Format to Hugo","description":"Many blogging platforms, such as Wordpress and Jekyll, use some variation of strptime to format date and time values. Hugo does time formatting in a completely different way and is based on the time package from Go. It uses the concept of a magic date as represented by:\nMon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006 Why that? When you convert it to all numericals you get the following:\n01/02 03:04:05PM &#39;06 -0700 Notice how it’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 for month, day, hour, minute, second, year, and time zone offset.","link":"https://www.client9.com/convert-strftime-time-format-to-hugo/","owner":"Nick Desaulniers"},{"title":"Remove Untagged Docker Images From Your Docker Host Via The CLI","description":"\n                    <p>If you’re like me, when it comes to Docker, you probably build images non-stop. I must admit that when I create images, I don’t create any special tags, even though I should. Instead every build uses the <code>latest</code> tag because that is enough to meet my needs. Regardless of what tags you use, you may find yourself building the same thing over and over. When this happens, the previous image remains on your machine, but becomes untagged to make room for the new build.</p>\n<p>So how do you prevent having potentially hundreds of untagged Docker images lingering on your machine?  We’re going to see how to quickly remove them.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/remove-untagged-docker-images-docker-host-cli/'>Remove Untagged Docker Images From Your Docker Host Via The CLI</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com'>The Polyglot ","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/remove-untagged-docker-images-docker-host-cli/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
