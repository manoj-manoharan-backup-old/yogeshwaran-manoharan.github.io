[{"title":"Create A Mobile App From Your Angular Web App With NativeScript","description":"\n                    <p>Angular is all the rage right now. It is a significant step in the right direction from its predecessor AngularJS 1 for numerous reasons, one being its decoupling from the document object model (DOM). This separation allows for applications to be built beyond the web browser. Take for example, the mobile development framework <a href=\"https://www.nativescript.org/\">NativeScript</a>, which allows you to develop native Android and iOS applications. There is no DOM in this framework, but yet we can still use Angular to develop our applications.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re going to take a look at how to take an Angular web application and bring it to mobile using NativeScript.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/07/create-a-mobile-app-from-your-angular-2-web-app-with-nativescript/'>Create A Mobile App From Your Angular Web App With NativeScript</a> appeared first on <a rel='nofollow' href='h","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/07/create-a-mobile-app-from-your-angular-2-web-app-with-nativescript/","owner":"Nic Raboy"},{"title":"Modesty in Simplicity: CockroachDB's JOIN","description":"CockroachDB&#x2019;s JOIN: An Early Implementation When our VP of engineering, Peter Mattis, made the decision in 2015 to support SQL, little did he know that the team would get as far as shipping the first implementation of CockroachDB&#x2019;s JOIN exactly one year after that.
