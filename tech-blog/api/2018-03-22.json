[{"title":"Be Flexible & Consistent: JSON Comes to CockroachDB","description":"We are excited to announce support for JSON in our 2.0 release (coming in April) and available now via our most recent 2.0 Beta release. Now you can use both structured and semi-structured data within the same database. No longer will you need to sacrifice ACID guarantees, accuracy, or the ability to scale in order to use multiple data models within the same database. This post will explain how we implemented JSON and give you a few examples of how JSON can be used to model your data.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/json-coming-to-cockroach/","owner":"CockroachDB"}]
