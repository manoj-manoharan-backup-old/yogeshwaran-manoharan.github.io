[{"title":"Rails migrations: decimal precision and scale","description":"I&rsquo;m always confused when using decimal in a Rails migration. Normally I need to store a value that has 2 or 3 numbers behind the comma (or dot), or decimals.\nLet&rsquo;s say you have a Product model with a discount_percentage attribute. This attribute is currently an integer, only allowing non-decimal values. To allow 2 digit decimal values (e.g. 12.54), you can mak the following migration:\nchange_column :products, :discount_percentage, :decimal, precision: 5, scale: 2 This will allow you to store values like 80.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2012/08/28/rails-migrations-decimal-precision-and-scale/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
