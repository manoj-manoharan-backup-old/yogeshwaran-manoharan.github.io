[{"title":"Create An Email Subscription Popup With jQuery","description":"\n                    <p>As you&rsquo;ll recall, The Polyglot Developer was once using WordPress. Back when I was using WordPress, I was using a plugin called Icegram, which is similar to SumoMe and OptinMonster, but it allowed me to present popups after a period of time to prompt users to subscribe to my newsletter.</p>\n<p>I get that not everyone appreciates an annoying popup, but it was great for me because I was getting a lot of new email subscribers very quickly.</p>\n<p>Since having dropped WordPress, I haven&rsquo;t been able to find a plugin that offered similar functionality to what I had. This inspired me to create my own plugin using jQuery that I could use anywhere, including my Hugo powered blog. We&rsquo;re going to see how to create our own opt-in style popup for collecting email leads.</p>\n                    \n                        <p>The post <a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/create-email-subscription-popup-jquery/'>Create An Email Sub","link":"https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/create-email-subscription-popup-jquery/","owner":"Nelson Elhage"}]
