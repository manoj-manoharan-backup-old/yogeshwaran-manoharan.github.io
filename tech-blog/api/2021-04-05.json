One data science team, the Forecasting, Estimation, and Demand team was in a bind. Their data generation process was causing them iteration &amp; operational frustrations in delivering time-series forecasts for the business. In this talk I’ll present Hamilton, a novel python micro framework, that solved their pain points by changing their working paradigm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n","link":"https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/04/05/MITW/","owner":"Stackshare"},{"title":"Powering Messaging Enabledness with Yelp's Data Infrastructure","description":"In addition to helping people find great places to eat, Yelp connects people with great local professionals to help them accomplish tasks like making their next big move, fixing that leaky faucet, or repairing a broken phone screen.
