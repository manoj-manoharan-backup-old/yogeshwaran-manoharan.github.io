[{"title":"Poor man's rspec mode for emacs","description":"For whatever reason rspec-mode didn&rsquo;t work for me. I couldn&rsquo;t either get it to use current version of Ruby or it used to crap out on Bundler detection.\nAnnoyed, I decided to write a very simple rspec-mode that works almost always. More importantly it runs rspec from root of current project directory using your current shell and hence you don&rsquo;t need to configure RVM or rbenv from Emacs. Whatever version of Ruby your shell has it will run using that.","link":"https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-03-28-poor-mans-rspec-mode-for-emacs/","owner":"Codelitt"}]
