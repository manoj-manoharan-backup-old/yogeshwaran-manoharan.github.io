[{"title":"Rails + MySQL: Case-Sensitive strings in your database","description":"When using Rails + MySQL, you&rsquo;ll find that normal string (or varchar(255)) fields are case insensitive. This can be quite a nuisance, but it&rsquo;s easy to resolve. You need to set your table to the utf8_bin collation. By using the binary variant, you&rsquo;re basically enabling case sensitivity.\ncreate_table :posts, :options =&gt; &#39;ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin&#39; do |t| t.string :title, :limit =&gt; 100 end That&rsquo;s all. The title field is now case sensitive.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2009/09/03/rails-mysql-case-sensitive-strings-in-your-database/","owner":"Antirez"}]
