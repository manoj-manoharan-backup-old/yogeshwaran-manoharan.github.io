[{"title":"Serializable, Lockless, Distributed: Isolation in CockroachDB","description":"Editor's Note: This post was originally authored when CockroachDB was pre-1.0. CockroachDB's architecture has undergone many changes since then. One of the most significant, as it relates to this post which focuses on our previous \"lockless\" design, is that we now use more locking and lock-like structures to provide SERIALIZABLE isolation. For more current details about CockroachDB's transaction model, read our transaction layer architecture documentation. ---------------\nSeveral months ago, I discussed how CockroachDB&#x2019;s distributed transactions are executed atomically.","link":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/serializable-lockless-distributed-isolation-cockroachdb/","owner":"Cloudflare"}]
