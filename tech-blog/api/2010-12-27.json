[{"title":"Some Android reverse-engineering tools","description":"I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time this last week staring at decompiled Dalvik assembly. In the process, I created a couple of useful tools that I figure are worth sharing.\nI&rsquo;ve been using dedexer instead of baksmali, honestly mainly because the former&rsquo;s output has fewer blank lines and so is more readable on my netbook&rsquo;s screen. Thus, these tools are designed to work with the output of dedexer, but the formats are simple enough that they should be easily portable to smali, if that&rsquo;s your tool of choice (And it does look like a better tool overall, from what I can see).","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/12/some-android-reverse-engineering-tools/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
