See part 1, testing degraded network scenarios with rkt , for detailed information about how traffic control works on Linux.\nIn this installment we demonstrate how to test web services with traffic control on Kubernetes . We introduce tcd , a simple traffic control daemon developed by Kinvolk for this demo. Our demonstration system runs on Openshift 3 , Red Hat’s Container Platform based on Kubernetes, and uses the excellent Weave Scope , an interactive container monitoring and visualization tool.","link":"/blog/2016/05/testing-web-services-with-traffic-control-on-kubernetes/","owner":"King"}]
