I do this also at work, and for my personal projects like CSE-Tool.\nThe question, however, is how to release your current code properly to the public. You probably don&rsquo;t want your users to check out your current development code. Either you want them to check out a certain version (release) or you want to present them with a download archive containing the code.","link":"https://www.devroom.io/2006/11/21/svn-how-to-release-software-properly/","owner":"Ariejan de Vroom"}]
