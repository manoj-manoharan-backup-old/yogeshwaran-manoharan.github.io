[{"title":"\nRedis Conference 2015\n","description":"I’m back home, after a non easy trip, since to travel from San Francisco to Sicily is kinda NP complete: there are no solutions involving less than three flights. However it was definitely worth it, because the Redis Conference 2015 was very good, SF was wonderful as usually and I was able to meet with many interesting people. Here I’ll limit myself to writing a short account of the conference, but the trip was also an incredible experience because I discovered old and new friends, that are not just smart programmers, but also people I could imagine being my friends here in Sicily. I never felt alone while I was 10k kilometers away from my home.\n","link":"\nhttp://antirez.com/news/87\n","owner":"Andrey Akinshin"},{"title":"Create A Random Nonce String Using JavaScript","description":"\n                    <p>Have you ever needed to come up with a random string of characters say for a password?
