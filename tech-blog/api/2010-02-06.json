[{"title":"CVE-2007-4573: The Anatomy of a Kernel Exploit","description":"CVE-2007-4573 is two years old at this point, but it remains one of my favorite vulnerabilities. It was a local privilege-escalation vulnerability on all x86_64 kernels prior to v2.6.22.7. It&rsquo;s very simple to understand with a little bit of background, and the exploit is super-simple, but it&rsquo;s still more interesting than Yet Another NULL Pointer Dereference. Plus, it was the first kernel bug I wrote an exploit for, which was fun.","link":"https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/02/cve-2007-4573-the-anatomy-of-a-kernel-exploit/","owner":"Natasha Murashev"}]
