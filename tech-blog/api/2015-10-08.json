[{"title":"Literals in Playgrounds","description":" New in Xcode 7.1 is the ability to embed file, image, and color literals into your playground&#8217;s code. Literals are the actual values of your data represented in their native format, directly within the Xcode editor. For instance, there’s no need to type “ myImage.jpg ” in the editor &#8211; just drag your image from the Finder and the actual image will appear in-line with your code. Instead of showing RGB values to indicate color, the playground will render a color swatch. Literals in playgrounds behave similarly to code you would otherwise hand-author in regular Swift code, but are rendered in a much more useful manner.  In addition to looking cool, literals can also make editing resources much faster. You can use the color picker to quickly choose a different color from the palette. Drag-and-drop files from the Finder into your playground code to start using them immediately. You can even add a literal at your current cursor position by selecting Editor ​> Insert File, Image, ","link":"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=33","owner":"Sketch"}]
